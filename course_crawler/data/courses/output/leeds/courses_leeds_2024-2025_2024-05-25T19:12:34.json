Our size enables us to incorporate an impressive range of specialisms within our curriculum, reflecting our ethos that music is music, regardless of genre or style. We attract a diverse body of students from across the UK and internationally, which gives the School a vibrant community and culture. Decolonisation, equality and inclusivity are embedded within our curriculum so all our students can feel a sense of belonging in the School and can thrive on their course no matter what their background and musical experience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the recent national Research Excellence Framework (REF2021) exercise, 93% of our research was considered to be ‘internationally excellent’ or better in terms of its originality, significance and rigour, with 56% rated as ‘world leading’, the highest classification. Each of these measures places us within the top 10 Schools of Music in the UK. Our staff expertise feeds directly into our curriculum, with relevant specialisms in music and wellbeing and applied music psychology.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We work closely with our students, particularly through our active Student Staff Partnership Forum, to ensure that we continue to offer the best possible experience to everyone studying in the School of Music. Our Industrial Advisory Board – an invited body of professionals from across the professional music sector, which includes several alumni within its membership – actively supports the ongoing development of our courses to ensure they deliver the skills and opportunities our students need to prepare them for life after University.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The School of Music is part of a strong musical community at the University of Leeds, and there are numerous\n    <a href=\"https://www.luu.org.uk/groups/\">\n     Leeds University Union (LUU) clubs and societies\n    </a>\n    that offer opportunities to get involved in music and performance activities.

You may also choose (provided you have the necessary prior knowledge and experience) an optional module that will enable you to focus on a specific area of music in depth, such performance, electronic music, or music psychology. Together, the core and optional modules will provide you with the knowledge and skills to develop musicological projects according to your own interests.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Your major project will take the form of a dissertation with a specific musicological focus, or a piece of applied or practice-led work such as an editing or transcription project, or an archival or fieldwork study, defining your topic in consultation with one of our expert staff. In addition to this, you may optionally choose to undertake a second, smaller musicological project on a topic of your own choice (a Short Dissertation, an Individual Project or, subject to approval, an International Research Project).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The course provides a logical progression from undergraduate music courses and will equip you with a range of skills desired by employers and of value in further research at\n   <a href=\"https://ahc.leeds.ac.uk/music-research-degrees\">\n    MPhil/PhD level\n   </a>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   We have a variety of\n   <a href=\"https://ahc.leeds.ac.uk/homepage/415/facilities\">\n    excellent facilities\n   </a>\n   to support your learning, including rehearsal, performance and practice spaces, recording and electronic music studios, a music psychology lab, and five libraries that provide access to a wide range of books, periodicals, and online resources.

Crucially, we don’t prioritise any one approach so you’ll get to work with historians who ask different kinds of questions, use different kinds of sources and who understand the past in different ways.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Core modules (‘Practicing Modern History’ and ‘Communicating History’) help you understand these different approaches and give you the critical skills to contribute to current historiographical debates. A 15,000-word research dissertation, closely supervised by a leading historian in their field, allows you to apply the knowledge and skills you have gained.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The School of History at Leeds has more than thirty members of staff currently working in the field of Modern History. We have long-standing strengths in British, European, American and colonial history but we also have experts working on East and South-East Asia, India, Africa, Latin America, Australia and the Middle East. Thematically, we also can offer a tremendous range of Modern History. We have specialists in medical history and the history of psychiatry, histories of race and gender, military history, the histories of childhood and the family, histories of protest and resistance, political, transnational and international history.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The MA Modern History enables you to immerse yourself in this diverse scholarly community; besides taught modules, you are encouraged to participate in the School’s research culture by attending research seminars, conferences and workshops.

Within this context, there is growing political and policy recognition of the need to better understand and address social inequalities.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The social sciences have an important role to play in mapping and understanding how inequalities arise and in tackling their causes and consequences. Innovative developments are offering new methodological, theoretical and empirical insights into entrenched and emerging inequalities of status, resource, outcome and opportunity.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   This interdisciplinary course explores all forms of inequality, as well as the social, political and economic implications. It will equip you with the necessary knowledge and skills to understand, research and analyse complex inequalities.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Capitalising on expertise in the\n   <a href=\"https://essl.leeds.ac.uk/sociology-masters\">\n    School of Sociology and Social Policy\n   </a>\n   and the\n   <a href=\"https://lssi.leeds.ac.uk/inequalities-research-network/\">\n    Leeds Inequalities Research Network\n   </a>\n   , you’ll harness leading analytical approaches combining qualitative, quantitative and data analytic methods.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In addition to offering an advanced understanding of rising material inequality, this course encourages an intersectional approach to understanding socio-economic stratification and how this links with physical (dis)ability, race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexuality, class and age.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   You’ll benefit from a stimulating intellectual environment and cutting-edge methodological approaches to comparing the formation and consequences of inequalities across a range of national and international contexts. Through an examination of geopolitical and socioeconomic shifts, such as urbanisation and globalisation, you are actively supported to critically interrogate the contemporary character and extent of social inequality.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The course offers an Applied Research Project (ARP) option as an alternative to the standard dissertation. The ARP is a dissertation run in partnership with a non-academic organisation and enables you to undertake research with direct policy and practice relevancies. We have a range of projects arranged in partnership with Voluntary Action Leeds, Leeds City Council and the University of Leeds Sustainability Service amongst others.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <h4>\n    Course highlights\n   </h4>\n   <p>\n    You’ll join a vibrant and dynamic research-led teaching and learning environment in the\n    <a href=\"https://essl.leeds.ac.uk/sociology-research-expertise\">\n     School of Sociology and Social Policy\n    </a>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You’ll benefit from the interdisciplinary expertise and extra-curricular activities hosted by the School and its research centres including those in\n    <a href=\"https://disability-studies.leeds.ac.uk/\">\n     Disability Studies\n    </a>\n    ,\n    <a href=\"https://cers.leeds.ac.uk/\">\n     Ethnicity and Racism Studies\n    </a>\n    ,\n    <a href=\"https://gender-studies.leeds.ac.uk/\">\n     Interdisciplinary Gender Studies\n    </a>\n    and\n    <a href=\"https://flag.leeds.ac.uk/\">\n     Research into Families, the Life Course and Generations\n    </a>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You’ll also access events through the\n    <a href=\"https://lssi.leeds.ac.uk/\">\n     Leeds Social Sciences Institute (LSSI)\n    </a>\n    , which fosters cross-departmental collaboration, learning and impact.

Matters of global security – from military conflict and terrorism to climate change and the shifting international order – present major challenges for governments and other stakeholders which demand new solutions.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The Masters in Global Security Challenges is designed to develop your knowledge of the complex and diverse issues which define the global security agenda. By studying this interdisciplinary course you’ll gain a comprehensive understanding of theoretical approaches in security studies and become equipped to consider key challenges and their policy responses through a critical lens.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   You’ll study a range of pressing real-world issues from a variety of security perspectives and consider the political and ethical implications of security interventions in these areas. Topics include armed conflict, development, migration, climate change, public health, and the Women, Peace and Security agenda.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Security challenges defy academic boundaries and must be analysed within their social, cultural, historical, legal and political contexts. This programme therefore draws from a wide range of disciplinary perspectives to interrogate the way we currently understand and address security issues.

The degree is necessarily interdisciplinary and leads to a wide spectrum of applications and opportunities.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   We draw upon the major traditions of cultural theory, including semiology, feminism and gender theory, psychoanalysis, deconstruction, and Frankfurt School theories of the aesthetic, the media and technology. Other important critical references are postcolonial and critical race theory, as well as posthumanism and ecocriticism.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Alongside this exposure to a range of critical paradigms, you will develop your skills in close analysis: your ability to identify and unpack the key elements of a critical work or cultural artefact. This attention to the ‘textuality’ of these various texts, broadly defined, constitutes a crucial link between theory and practice, such that the line between critical and creative cultural practice is no longer determinative.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <h3>\n    Our diverse and dynamic approach\n   </h3>\n   <p>\n    Cultural studies emerged as a discipline in the mid-20th century as a critical, scholarly response to the social movements of the time – anti-colonial struggles, the civil rights movement and feminism – and as a rigorous study of the relations between culture and class.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This course began in 1987, when an interdisciplinary MA in Cultural Studies was founded at Leeds. From the outset, the course emphasised the theoretical, philosophical and historical aspects of cultural studies. The name was changed to better reflect this approach, and it continues to draw students from across the humanities who are thinking about and working with a broad range of objects and genres including literature, film, visual arts, performance, music and philosophy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The\n    <a href=\"http://ahc.leeds.ac.uk/fine-art\">\n     School of Fine Art, History of Art and Cultural Studies\n    </a>\n    has an ambitious interdisciplinary purpose, an active fine art community, a critically and politically engaged social history of art degree and a dynamic museum studies course. While this rich context is one of its defining characteristics, this degree is not limited to a consideration of art and aesthetics. Our approach is also informed by other cultural forms, such as text, music and popular culture and critical traditions – from literary criticism and semiology to sound studies and new thinking on technology, gender, and the posthuman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The School houses\n    <a href=\"https://ahc.leeds.ac.uk/fine-art-research-innovation/doc/parallax/page/1\">\n     parallax\n    </a>\n    , published by Taylor &amp; Francis, an internationally distributed journal of cultural theory and analysis.\n   </p>\n   <h3>\n    Specialist facilities\n   </h3>\n   <p>\n    Housed within a single central campus location, the School offers a modern and well-equipped learning environment with several exhibition spaces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The University library is one of the major academic research libraries in the UK, holding a variety of\n    <a href=\"https://www.leeds.ac.uk/masters-academic-experience/doc/academic-experience-facilities%C2%A0\">\n     manuscript, archive and early printed material\n    </a>\n    in its Special Collections - valuable assets for your independent research.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </div>\n</section>\n", "start_dates": [{"value": "September 2024"}], "application_dates": [], "entry_requirements": "<p>You’ll need a bachelor degree with a 2:1 (hons) or equivalent qualification in a humanities or social science subject, such as History, Literature, Languages, Art History, Philosophy, Sociology, or Media or in a practice-based Arts subject where your degree included a significant proportion of historical and theoretical studies.</p><p><strong>Applying from China</strong><br/><br/>Due to the large numbers of applications we receive, we’re only able to offer places to applicants who have attended <a href=\"http://www.leeds.ac.uk/international-admissions/doc/accepted-chinese-institutions-postgraduate-admissions\">selected Chinese institutions</a>.

This course is ideal if you are interested in exploring the complexities of societal conflict and peacebuilding around the world.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   By bridging themes of conflict, liberal styles of governance and aid policy, you will analyse the ways in which security, development and humanitarian actors adapt to instability.

Both are leading research centres which address the politics of global challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The programme directly addresses the increasing merging of development and security issues in international stabilization policies, and the challenges involved in reconstructing war-affected societies. It also explores the difficulties and controversies inherent in international activities aimed at building peace and stability within societies. It will equip you with the skills and knowledge required for employment in the expanding field of humanitarian response and social reconstruction, as well as practitioners wishing to study relevant issues in more depth.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   You’ll benefit from a course that occupies a bridging position within politics and international studies and – through the wide range of optional modules – draws upon the School's rich diversity of approaches and experience.\n  </p>\n  <h3>\n   Security at Leeds\n  </h3>\n  <p>\n   This course is part of a suite of three postgraduate courses in the School of Politics and International Studies with a focus on security issues.

Based on an interdisciplinary approach, the programme is supported by three pillars:\n   <strong>\n    Design, Research,\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    Business\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The\n   <strong>\n    Design\n   </strong>\n   pillar approaches the elaboration of communication campaigns as a design process, providing a framework for its development, as well as equipping students with an understanding of design principles across specialised areas such as graphic, typographic and digital design.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The\n   <strong>\n    Business\n   </strong>\n   pillar is offered in collaboration with the Leeds University Business School - a top 100 business schools worldwide - and introduces students to essential knowledge in consumer behaviour and media planning, enabling them to develop effective communication strategies based on market insights and brand positioning.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Finally, the\n   <strong>\n    Research\n   </strong>\n   pillar focuses on skills that are valuable to both academia and industry. Students will explore primary and secondary research methods, seamlessly integrating those into the design process, informing and evaluating their production using both quantitative and qualitative data. Moreover, students will have the option to expand those skills further by working on dissertations or research papers.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Assessment employs diverse approaches tailored to evaluate academic, professional, and digital literacies. Assessment components in design modules reflect authentic professional practices, incorporating industry briefs and student competitions. Criteria for assessments are flexible, accommodating individual skills and career choices. Exams and reflective reports evaluate theoretical comprehension and critical thinking applied to design processes. Students have the option to pursue an academic-focused dissertation or an industry-focused final project, both supported by a research-led approach.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Upon completion of the program, students will have acquired a wide range of skills, including evaluating market trends, analysing brand positioning, and formulating objectives and strategies to address communication challenges. They also develop the ability to generate creative concepts, design effective solutions, and conduct research to inform and reflect on design outcomes.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    Specialist facilities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The School of Design offers excellent facilities and technical support for developing your creative skills.

Furthermore, videos are consistently supplementing or even replacing text in training, marketing content and websites.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Parallelly, the demand for localisation and accessibility also increases. This means that the audiovisual and localisation industry is in need of professionals capable of providing not just subtitling, dubbing, and voice over services in as many foreign languages as possible; but also subtitles for the deaf and the hard of hearing, audio descriptions for blind and partially-sighted people, and live subtitles for people with difficulties accessing the content of a speech.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Working in audiovisual translation and media localisation is an exciting career that requires excellent knowledge of foreign languages, but also a good understanding of intercultural communication, translation and localisation technology, terminology and project management, as well as an excellent knowledge of the industry.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The MA in Audiovisual Translation and Localisation at Leeds will prepare you in all these areas and in your language combination, increasing your confidence and career prospects.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Core modules will introduce you to essential concepts in translation theory, audiovisual translation, accessibility, localisation, project management, and computer-assisted translation. You’ll also benefit from hands-on practice in our specialised IT labs throughout the year. You’ll work with professionals, using industry-standard software whilst developing specialised skills through individual assignments and team projects with simulated real-life scenarios.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   You’ll also be able to study modules informed by research taking place at our Centre for Translation Studies on topics such as machine translation, multimodality, corpus linguistics, interpreting, genre analysis, and others.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   As a proud member of the international association of translation and interpretation university institutes (\n   <a href=\"http://www.ciuti.org/\">\n    CIUTI\n   </a>\n   ), the European Language Industry Association (\n   <a href=\"https://elia-association.org/\">\n    ELIA\n   </a>\n   ), the Institute of Translation and Interpreting (\n   <a href=\"https://www.iti.org.uk/\">\n    ITI\n   </a>\n   ), and the Globalization and Localization Association (\n   <a href=\"https://www.gala-global.org/about/about-gala\">\n    GALA\n   </a>\n   ) the Centre for Translation Studies also maintains privileged collaboration with several UN and EU bodies, as well as national and international companies, institutions and NGOs.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   You’ll work between English and one or two other languages, including Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n  </p>\n  <h3>\n   Specialist facilities\n  </h3>\n  <p>\n   Our specialised translation and audiovisual translation laboratories support all our translation courses, complete with 60 high-spec PCs and a wide range of specialist software for translation, subtitling, respeaking, dubbing, audio-description, localisation, terminology management, and project management.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   In addition to translation theory and specialised translation, this course focuses on providing you with training in the different facets of the language services industry.

You'll examine how policy makers, cultural organisations, and artists conceptualise the role of audience in contemporary cultures and economies on both a local and global scale. You’ll learn how to research arts audiences and evaluate visitor experiences. This will help you develop your professional practice as well as engage your intellectual curiosity.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The arts have enormous potential to effect positive change in society. However, participation data has uncovered a lack of diversity in the age, ethnicity, education level and socioeconomic background of audiences in the cultural sector, alongside a decline in overall levels of arts engagement. This sits alongside efforts to address accessibility and structural inequality for both audiences and the creative workforce.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   This course allows you to respond and contribute to the highly topical debate surrounding strategies to increase engagement and participation, while pursuing your own interests and career ambitions. Through a combination of theoretical analysis and research, you’ll explore the possibility of creating a more genuinely participatory culture while developing your own skills in techniques and practices of engagement.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   You’ll explore theoretical concepts such as co-creation and participatory governance, alongside investigation into community and participatory arts practice, the implications of digital engagement, and conceptual design of audience experiences. Through a wide variety of optional modules you can cultivate applied skills in a range of disciplines, such as digital storytelling, creative production and heritage management.\n  </p>\n  <h3>\n   Additional highlights\n  </h3>\n  <p>\n   You will also be able to engage with leading centres for research, policy, practice and debate based at the University of Leeds that are on the forefront of audience research and engagement such as the Centre for Cultural Value and the Cultural Institute.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Leeds has a thriving cultural scene and is home to large-scale events like Leeds International Film Festival, Light Night, and Transform Festival.

These two strands are closely connected through exploring the role that culture and languages play in shaping our identity, influencing social relations and affecting aspects of power.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   You’ll also focus on additional topics that suit your interests and aspirations, as you choose from optional modules across different disciplines or contexts. You could study modules focusing on applied translation, gender and equality, linguistics, and international organisations, among many others. You could even study a foreign language. If you’re looking for a career with an international dimension, this course will allow you to develop the knowledge, cultural awareness, and practical skills to succeed.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   We’re a truly international university, with over 30,000 students from more than 130 countries and a large, diverse team of leading researchers and practitioners.\n  </p>\n  <h3>\n   Specialist facilities\n  </h3>\n  <p>\n   Our students benefit from this stimulating learning environment while developing their skills in state-of-the-art facilities; as well as our world-class research library, you could practice translation in the Martin Thomas Translation Labs. These Labs support all of our translation programmes, complete with around 60 high-spec PCs and a wide range of specialist software for translation and subtitling. It’s an excellent place to gain an insight into the relations between cultural groups while gaining valuable practical skills.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   If you’re looking to develop your foreign language skills, you can access the Language Zone, which provides learning materials in over 50 languages, as well as study space, digital resources and workshops and activities.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RVxx-xiyWGU\" width=\"560\">\n   </iframe>\n  </p>\n </div>\n</section>\n", "start_dates": [{"value": "September 2024"}], "application_dates": [{"value": "12 August 2024"}, {"value": "13 343 0233"}, {"value": "13 343 3234"}], "entry_requirements": "<p><div>A bachelor degree with a 2:1 (hons).

This distinctive one year MRes has a strong emphasis on developing skills for practice as a specialist and practical application within exercise and rehabilitation environments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our MRes is based in the sport and exercise sciences department which has a wealth of expertise in the area of rehabilitation, with students being taught by some of the country’s leading sport and exercise scientists. Being part of the cardiovascular and sport and exercise sciences group, we are ranked highly in both UK and international studies*.

The programme offers a strong focus on high-quality research and clinical skills training. It provides an opportunity to critically and creatively evaluate current theory and practice issues.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Psychotherapeutic theory which prioritises the therapeutic relationship as the crucial factor will be critically examined and you will be encouraged to learn more about yourself in relationships, to develop your own approach to therapy based on your own values and beliefs (a values-based approach). You will be able to deliver psychological therapy across different socio-cultural contexts, considering the ethical and intersectional dimensions of your practice.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   We teach a relational ‘not knowing’ approach to counselling and psychotherapy. This means that the focus is on the therapy relationship. It is consistent with the evidence base that the ‘common factors’ which describe aspects of the relationship are responsible for positive outcomes in therapy. The course also covers the philosophical foundations to relational intersubjective theories.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   You will be equipped to work as a professional counsellor/psychotherapist and make independent clinical decisions in a variety of settings, including complex and unpredictable situations. You will learn to carry out specialist psychotherapeutic assessments, communicate and present complex and sensitive information and gain knowledge of adult safeguarding procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   You will engage in experiential learning activities to develop your self- and intersubjective awareness when becoming a relational practitioner. Many students bring a wealth of personal experience that helps them to reflect on a range of human issues.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In addition to the taught elements of the programme, you must complete 100 supervised practice hours to become eligible for BACP membership. You must find your own placement but our practice placement unit has a comprehensive list of approved placement opportunities in a variety of clinical settings and are available to support you.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   You’ll benefit from the knowledge of experienced counsellors, psychotherapists and practitioner psychologists, with senior levels of registration. Our teaching staff are also active researchers, with a range of specialisms. You’ll develop the knowledge and skills to conduct independent in-depth research into a complex specialist area.\n  </p>\n  <h3>\n   Course highlights\n  </h3>\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    High-quality and intensive clinical skills training enabling you to become effective relational practitioners.\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    Maximum of 24 students per cohort. This small group approach enables personal support from your peers and tutors help with the emotional challenges of the learning experience.\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    Level 3 adult safeguarding covered as part of the course.\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    The course includes teaching on online practice, therapy with all age ranges and neurodiversity. A percentage of your placement hours can be with children and young people.\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    You will be learning from a passionate academic team with varied psychotherapeutic modalities such as: third wave behavioural and cognitive psychotherapies, person-centred and existential not-knowing approach, attachment, psychoanalytic and integrative approaches. Therapeutic practice is modelled in different teaching methods with a focus on relationships, creative and experiential methods.\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    The course content is enriched and influenced by the active research of the staff team, who are all conducting important and novel research within this field.\n   </li>\n  </ul>\n  <h3>\n   Watch the course video\n  </h3>\n  <p>\n   Discover more about our course community, hear about the programme journey from current students, and learn how skills are developed.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qxp_wBU8JKE\" width=\"560\">\n   </iframe>\n  </p>\n  <h3>\n   Accreditation\n  </h3>\n  <p>\n   <a href=\"http://www.bacp.co.uk/\">\n    Accredited by the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy\n   </a>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <p>\n    MA Psychotherapy and Counselling has received British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) accredited course status which, on successful completion, will allow you to be added to their voluntary assured register of practitioners.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </div>\n</section>\n", "start_dates": [{"value": "September 2024"}], "application_dates": [{"value": "49 April 2024"}, {"value": "14 May 2024"}, {"value": "13 June 2024"}], "entry_requirements": "<p><ul><li>A bachelor degree with a 2:1 (hons) in any subject or other proof of your ability to study at Masters level.</li><li>Proof of counselling skills.
