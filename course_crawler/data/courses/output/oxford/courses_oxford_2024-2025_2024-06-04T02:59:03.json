The programme aims to deliver the next generation of bioscience leaders to advance research on the underpinning bioscience of viral products for future gene therapies and vaccines.", "about": "<div class=\"field-item even\"><div id=\"content-tab\"><p>This DPhil course will take a holistic approach to the science underpinning the successful development of new viral vector products including an understanding of the fundamental cell biology, bioprocessing considerations, improving our knowledge of the process/product, understand how these aspects can be translated and advanced in an industrial setting and identify how these fit into the wider regulatory context.</p><p>A core component of this training programme is to immerse students in an environment where they are able to apply their fundamental scientific knowledge and research expertise to addressing the current capacity and capability issues in viral vector development.</p><p>Throughout your training, you will work in interdisciplinary teams across the cohort, integrate your activities, share your knowledge and disseminate your research findings within the academic/industrial/clinical communities and to the public. All students on this course will undertake a placement with an industrial partner as part of their studies. An example of working across interdisciplinary teams will be ensuring student projects are designed to enable effective leveraging of data, tools and processes across research activities. Experimental and biological data generated from one project will feed into a project focused on employing advanced computational methods, which can then be used to feedback into the original project and inform future experimental design to inform our biological understanding.</p><p>You will receive significant subject-specific knowledge and practical training in viral vector development, bioprocessing and production, including methods for virus generation, purification and characterisation. In parallel, you will also receive significant translational training with a focus on business/commercial analysis, understanding of the regulatory framework for advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) and training in Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) including documentation preparation and compliance with Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), preparation of a Technology Transfer process, working within stringent Quality Management Systems (QMS) and how to file for a regulatory submission. Additionally the concept of quality by design (QbD) is widely adopted in the industry to build quality and consistency into processes; this concept also aligns with expectations from global regulatory agencies.</p><p>Through a recent partnership with Microsoft Research, Oxford Biomedica also recognise that frontier bioscience and the emerging 21st century bioscience landscape necessitates a breaking down of traditional scientific boundaries, towards a model that embraces the emergence of mathematical, computational and data science tools such as AI and ML for the production, management and analysis of research data. You will be trained to grapple with the biological complexity and apply these tools to your respective research activities to extract meaning and enhance understanding from your data. It will also focus on empowering you to learn concise technical writing skills, which form a basis for successful communication and dissemination of data and findings across academia and industry. This is increasingly important as bioscience researchers are often generating large datasets which can benefit from a ‘big data’ approach to data analysis, in addition to using these tools to improve viral vector design, as has been the case with the emergence of ML to improve adeno associated virus (AAV) vector capsid design. Again, this aligns strongly with the collaboration OXB has established with Microsoft Research, making use of AI/ML approaches to gain insights from complex datasets to inform future areas of development/process improvement.</p><p>Given recent significant global developments for both viral vectors and vaccine development, the course will be managed in a way that closely monitors and tracks current UK government and international community focus, particularly in the area of vaccine development and production, and will monitor progress with related/adjacent technologies (eg non-viral technologies) that may evolve over the course of your studies.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision is the responsibility of the Medical Sciences Doctoral Training Centre and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Medical Sciences Doctoral Training Centre.</p><p>Students will be allocated at least two supervisors, one of whom will be an Oxford academic and one will be from Oxford Biomedica.  Students will usually meet their primary supervisor weekly or fortnightly in the early stages of their project.  There will be many opportunities for collaboration with additional research groups throughout the studentship.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>All students will be initially admitted to the status of Probationer Research Student (PRS). Within a maximum of six terms as a PRS student you will be expected to apply for transfer of status from Probationer Research Student to DPhil status.</p><p>A successful transfer of status from PRS to DPhil status will require the submission of a report on progress to date on research and future plans. Students who are successful at transfer will also be expected to apply for and gain confirmation of DPhil status within ten terms of admission, to show that your work continues to be on track.</p><p>Both milestones normally involve an interview with two assessors (other than your supervisor) and therefore provide important experience for the final oral examination.</p><p>You will be expected to submit an original thesis of up to 50,000 words within a maximum of four years from the date of admission. To be successfully awarded a DPhil in Advanced Bioscience of Viral Products you will need to defend your thesis orally (viva voce) in front of two appointed examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>The DPhil in Advanced Bioscience of Viral Products launched in 2022, and is now accepting applications for its third year intake. The programme aims to equip graduates to advance their careers and to take up leadership roles in fields such as Immunology, Industrial Biotechnology and Bioprocessing, Microbiology, Pharmaceuticals, and Synthetic Biology.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

The first must be chosen from the following list of undergraduate papers in ancient philosophy:</p><ul><li>Plato: Republic</li><li>Plato on Knowledge, Language &amp; Reality in the <em>Theaetetus </em>and <em>Sophist</em></li><li>Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics</li><li>Aristotle on Nature, Life and Mind</li><li>Knowledge and Scepticism in Hellenistic Philosophy</li><li>Latin philosophy</li></ul><p>Tuition for these subjects is offered in the form of supervisions, as well as lectures and classes. </p><p>The second subject option consists of two classes, which change every year, and you must attend both classes. In the last four years, the following classes have been on offer, which give an idea of the sort of subjects that have been tackled: Plato on Education, Happiness and Time in Ancient Philosophy, Seneca’s Moral Letters, Aristotle’s Defence of Natural Slavery and its Legacy, <em>Techne</em> in Ancient Philosophy, Vice in Ancient Philosophy, Virtue and Eros in Stoic Philosophy, The Ontology of Action: Aristotle and After, The Stoics on Emotions, Plato and Aristotle on Truth, Prudence in Aristotle’s Ethics, Sophistry and Fallacy in Plato and Aristotle, and Plato’s Political Philosophy.</p><p>Finally, you will write a thesis of 10,000 to 15,000 words on a topic you have chosen in consultation with the course coordinator and a prospective supervisor.</p><p>In a typical fortnight during term-time, a student can expect to spend around one hour receiving one-to-one supervision, between four and eight hours attending ancient philosophy seminars, and up to six hours of Ancient Greek tuition (voluntary). This translates as around 20–30% of a full-time working week. Students can expect to spend the remaining time on self-directed study.</p><p>It is not a course requirement for students without any (or with little) Ancient Greek to attend the language classes currently run by the Faculty of Classics, but it is highly recommended that they do so, as being able to read philosophical texts in the original language is an advantage for Ancient Philosophy students. Students with intermediate or advanced Greek may choose to attend more advanced Ancient Greek classes.</p><p>Each term many graduate classes and research seminars are organised by faculty members in which graduate students are full and important participants.</p><p>Moreover, during term-time the Faculty of Philosophy normally offers a weekly workshop that allows members of the faculty and graduate students to discuss work in progress in ancient philosophy by speakers from Oxford and elsewhere. All graduate students specialising in ancient philosophy are encouraged to attend this workshop.</p><p>You may also decide to attend any graduate or undergraduate classes, seminars and lectures in and outside of the Faculty of Philosophy which are of interest to you, provided those classes, seminars and lectures are open to you.</p><p>Graduates are encouraged to organise their own seminars and reading groups, and they also run two societies: one invites distinguished speakers from the UK and around the world, while the other gives graduates the opportunity to present papers to a graduate audience.</p><p>Each year there is an Oxford Graduate Philosophy Conference, in which most graduate philosophy students participate in some way.</p><p>The course has no fieldwork, industrial placement or year abroad element, but you may decide to attend conferences, workshops or research training elsewhere.</p><h3>Course outcomes</h3><p>Upon completion of the course, you should have:</p><ul><li>pursued a course requiring a high standard in each of the three examined elements (a thesis and two subject options);</li><li>selected at least two areas of ancient philosophy and studied them through individual supervisions with an expert supervisor and either by lectures (offered by an expert or experts in the relevant field) or by classes (convened by an expert or experts in the relevant field) at which students give presentations;</li><li>written a thesis under the guidance of an expert supervisor;</li><li>had the opportunity to attain some knowledge of Ancient Greek, or consolidate and increase existing knowledge;</li><li>had many opportunities to hear and give talks in philosophy, by attending the annual Graduate Philosophy Conference, talks by invited speakers, philosophy societies, and discussion groups; and</li><li>been a member of a college graduate community, associating with graduates from many countries, cultures, and academic disciplines.</li></ul><h3>Supervision</h3><p>For this course, the allocation of graduate supervision is the responsibility of the Faculty of Philosophy and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Faculty of Philosophy and Faculty of Classics.</p><p>You should normally expect to have four one-hour supervision sessions per term with your appointed supervisor for that term. Before each supervision you will research, write and submit a formative supervision essay on which you receive detailed feedback in the one-to-one supervision session. This should then allow you to further improve your essay for assessment. </p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>In addition to writing your thesis, you will be assessed through written work. The first subject option will be assessed by one 5,000-word essay on a topic chosen by you and approved by the course co-ordinator.</p><p>Assessment of the second subject option is by two 5,000-word essays on topics linked to the area covered in the two classes you have taken. You may choose to write both essays on topics linked to one class or to write one essay on a topic linked to the first class and the other essay on a topic linked to the second, but overlap in subject material between the essays is to be avoided.</p><p>If you pass the MSt in Ancient Philosophy, you will have the opportunity to apply to continue to the <a href=\"//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/dphil-philosophy\">DPhil in Philosophy</a> via a year as a Probationary Research Student. However, if you have no to little Ancient Greek and you would like to progress to the DPhil in Philosophy, you should attend the Ancient Greek classes as attendance and progress in these classes will normally be an academic condition for admission to the DPhil in Philosophy.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>MSt in Ancient Philosophy graduates often progress to doctoral programmes, either at the faculty itself or elsewhere. Some, however, have pursued non-philosophical academic careers, or careers outside academia, including banking, information technology, law, management consultancy, teaching and public service. The graduate destinations of past MSt students are available on the <a href=\"https://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/mst-ancient-philosophy-alumni-information\">MSt alumni webpages</a>.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

Part I is the first year of taught study during which you must be resident in Oxford if you are studying full-time. If studying part-time, you must participate regularly in accordance with University regulations for part-time study. You may transfer from full-time to part-time after the first year. As a part-time student, you may be non-residential but you must attend classes and seminars in Oxford on one day each week (currently Fridays) during your first year and continue to take part in occasional seminars and supervisions for your essays during the subsequent years. Colleges may offer further seminars for their Applied Theology students.</p><p>You will take four units in total during Part I. The two core units are:</p><ul><li>Doctrine, Context and Practice</li><li>Experiential Project with Theological Reflection.</li></ul><p>Further units may include the following options, subject to supervisor availability:</p><ul><li>Sociology of Religion</li><li>Pastoral Psychology</li><li>Science and Faith in the Modern World</li><li>The Use of the Bible</li><li>Christian Spirituality</li><li>Liturgy and Worship</li><li>Christian Ethics</li><li>Mission in the Modern World</li><li>Inter-faith Dialogue</li><li>Ecclesiology in an Ecumenical Context</li></ul><p>Core classes and seminars on methodology and approaches in applied theology will be offered weekly. If studying part-time, you will attend these classes during their first year. The classes will include required reading and discussion. Extended essays for particular units will be supervised by an individual tutor. In addition to the core classes, the Applied Theology Research Seminars provide an opportunity for all students to hear from senior members of the University as well as visiting scholars. The Research Presentation Seminars allow students to present their current research to one another and receive feedback. Thus there is a balance of supported learning and independent research.</p><p>You will be encouraged to attend lectures and postgraduate seminars offered by the Faculty of Theology and Religion. Participation in some of these may require permission of the convenor.</p><p>In Part II of the MTh, you will write a dissertation of up to 20,000 words on an agreed aspect of applied theology. This dissertation can be completed part-time.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>You will be assigned supervisors to help you formulate and prepare your essay projects, as well as the dissertation. The number of meetings with supervisors will vary, but you should expect regular, at least fortnightly interactions with supervisors, tutors or course coordinators, whether at classes or in one-to-one meetings.</p><p>For this course, the allocation of graduate supervision is the responsibility of the Faculty of Theology and Religion and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Faculty of Theology and Religion.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>In addition to a dissertation on an agreed aspect of applied theology (Part II), each unit in Part I is assessed by an extended essay. There are two submission windows each year: after the end of Hilary term (Friday of 0th week of Trinity term) and at the end of the Long Vacation (Friday of 0th week of Michaelmas term). In most circumstances, full-time students submit one essay (typically the Doctrine, Context and Practice unit), or occasionally two, after the end of Hilary term and the rest of the Part I essays at the end of the Long Vacation. Occasionally, permission is given to submit the Experiential Project at the end of Hilary term of the second year. The dissertation must be submitted by the end of the second Long Vacation. Submission timelines for part-time students typically require at least one essay submitted ideally by the end of the first Hilary term but at the latest by the end of the first Long Vacation and the rest of the Part I essays by the end of the second Long Vacation. The dissertation would then be due before completing their time on the course.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Students who leave the University of Oxford with graduate degrees in theology enter a variety of careers all around the world. The majority who graduate with the MTh in Applied Theology secure employment in Christian ministry or other faith-based pastoral contexts. Occasionally students have progressed to doctoral study from the MTh.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

Its small-group teaching format pursues the Oxford tradition of demanding much of students and giving them much in return. </p><p>The course is taught over two academic years, preceded by a week’s induction module in Oxford. Numbers on the course are kept low, to ensure quality of teaching and learning.</p><p>The course consists of six summatively assessed modules, two in Term 1 and one in Term 2 of each year, and a dissertation of between 15,000 and 20,000 words submitted at the end of the course. Beginning in Term 3 of the first year of the course, students work on their dissertation projects under the supervision of a member of the applied linguistics research group. </p><p>In addition to these summatively assessed modules, students take a formatively assessed module on Research Methods in Term 2 of the first year, to help prepare them for their dissertation projects.

Materials are made available on the University’s virtual learning environment two weeks in advance of the expected completion date for the associated activities. There is, therefore, flexibility in the dates and pattern of participation each week to fit into your work schedule. Attendance, either in-person or online, will be required for a one-week induction module, which is held prior to commencement of the course, usually in late August.

The course will prepare you for further academic research or for work as a professional development economist in international agencies, governments or the private sector.", "about": "<div class=\"field-item even\"><div id=\"content-tab\"><h3>Course objectives</h3><p>The course seeks to cultivate the analytical and critical skills relevant to economic development, in particular those needed to assess alternative approaches to policy. It provides the rigorous quantitative training that development work now requires, helping you develop the ability to access, process and interpret a variety of data. It aims to provide the research tools and approaches needed for those who wish to proceed to doctoral research in development economics.</p><h3>Courses structure</h3><p>You will take courses in economic theory (split between macroeconomics, microeconomics and international trade), a course in quantitative methods (ie econometrics) and a choice of four or five from a series of at least eight elective modules in development economics. Topics vary from year to year. In recent years, modules have covered topics such as agriculture, political economy and institutions, globalisation, macroeconomic policy, behavioural economics, risk and microfinance. </p><p>A central component of the course is a dissertation written on a subject which you choose in consultation with your supervisor and with the agreement of your Course Director. More information on the structure of the course is available in the course handbook on the departmental website’s course page.</p><h3>Teaching and learning</h3><p>The course is taught through lectures and classes and, for the development modules, student presentations. The quantitative methods course also includes hands-on training in the use of specialist statistical software. Class sizes are small – usually between 5 and 30 students – encouraging active participation and enabling students to learn from each other.</p><p>During the course you will be required to complete a number of problem sets and write essays for individual supervisors (the tutorial system). This system is used to build critical and analytical skills and is particularly beneficial to students from a different background of instruction.</p><p>Around 65% - 75% of your time will be spent on lectures and guided study, with the remaining 25% - 35% devoted to self-directed work, much of which will be spent on your dissertation.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision is the responsibility of the Oxford Department of International Development, in conjunction with the Department of Economics, and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff.</p><p>You will be allocated a general supervisor who will support your academic development and with whom you will meet regularly throughout the course. Allocation is based on your research interests, optimal fit with the supervisor’s expertise, and staff availability. In cases where dissertation supervision requires expertise that is not available among the core staff, an additional dissertation supervisor with expertise in the chosen field may be identified. In addition, you will have a college advisor whom you may consult on issues concerning your personal wellbeing.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>On-course assessment, which will not count towards your final degree, will be provided through feedback on problem sets and essays. In addition there will be five informal examinations during the year. Again, these will not count towards your final degree but they will provide an invaluable opportunity to assess your progress and for you to practise exam technique.</p><p>The degree is formally assessed through examination at the end of the summer term. This comprises four written papers: microeconomic theory, macroeconomic theory and international trade, quantitative methods, and development economics. The dissertation will be submitted before the examinations and your final mark will be aggregated from the results of the examinations and the dissertation.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><blockquote class=\"cis-hide\" style=\"margin: 0 7% 1.5em 1.5em;\"><p>The MSc was the perfect way for me to re-engage with my interest in development economics and acquire rigorous technical skills that will set me up for a career in international development. I hugely enjoyed the course material and research opportunities presented by the course, but above all, I valued the time spent with professors and course mates discussing big topics in development.</p><p>Julia, MSc student </p></blockquote><p>Approximately one third of MSc graduates proceed to doctoral research in economics, either immediately or after work experience in the field. Of these, two or three will usually continue to the doctoral programme in Economics in Oxford. Significant numbers of MSc graduates proceed to work in the major international financial institutions such as the World Bank, the IMF and the UN system, as well as in the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office. Many others work in the international NGO sector and for major consultancies.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

The department also has close connections with other departments and research centres across the University.</p><p>As a DPhil student you will undertake your own original research project under the guidance of your supervisor, whom you will typically meet two to three times a term. The supervisor will help develop and guide your project and, at later stages, provide feedback on chapter drafts. However, you will work to a significant extent on your own, and you will need a high level of motivation and self-discipline.</p><p>During an initial probationary period as a Probationer Research Student (PRS), you will develop and begin work on your thesis topic. You will be offered training in relevant research methods, language, computing and other skills, and you will have the opportunity to attend lectures, seminars and classes in your general topic area. Full-time students are expected to be resident in Oxford for the PRS period.</p><p>As a PRS, you will also take one taught course, either in research methods or from an Oxford master’s degree relevant to your research, which will be examined. Full-time students usually transfer to full DPhil status by the end of their first year and part-time students usually transfer by the end of their second year.</p><p>Following satisfactory progress and transfer to full DPhil status, you may leave Oxford for up to three terms (six terms for part-time students) in order to conduct fieldwork, if the project requires. You will then continue the course by carrying out your own research under the guidance of your supervisor, with whom you will continue to meet or correspond with regularly. Full-time students should return to Oxford after fieldwork for at least three terms.</p><p>Time to completion depends on the complexity of an individual student’s research programme and on the amount of fieldwork that may be required. The University considers that the normal time for completion of the DPhil should be three to four years (four to eight years for part-time), or for students who transfer to the DPhil after the MPhil in Development Studies two to three years (four to six years for part-time), although the exact time will vary depending on the complexity and ambition of the project.

In addition, where appropriate, students will be required to obtain the written agreement from their employer for the use of their employer’s data in their research.</p><p>As a part-time student you will be required to attend classes, seminars, supervision meetings and other obligations in Oxford for a certain number of days each year. In your first year as a probationer student, it is expected that you will need to be resident in Oxford for a minimum of 48 working days in the year in order to participate in induction activities at the start of the academic year and then classes and seminars for your Qualifying Examination. The exact days will depend on the choice of course for the Qualifying Examination and whether the classes take place in Michaelmas or Hilary term.</p><p>After the probationary period, you will be required to be resident for a minimum of 30 days of university-based work each year, normally coinciding with the full terms of the academic year. These days will be arranged with the agreement of your supervisor and will be for the period that your name remains on the Register of Graduate Students unless individually dispensed by the Departmental Graduate Studies Committee.</p><p>There will be limited flexibility in the dates and pattern of attendance, which will be determined by mutual agreement with your supervisor.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Oxford Department of International Development and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. </p><p>In the case of students who require specific help to adjust to an academic programme or to a new range of skills, the supervisor will work with them to ensure that they have additional support.</p><p>The availability of supervision varies year on year and candidates are advised to review the list of eligible supervisors from the department’s webpage for the DPhil course to ensure their areas of interest are compatible.</p><p>Each student/supervisor relationship is different and the number of meetings varies, but generally, students are likely to meet with their supervisor two or three times per term.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>You will be admitted initially as a Probationer Research Student (PRS). At the end of your first year, you will be examined on one taught course (either in research methods or from an Oxford master’s degree relevant to your research). You must pass this course with a strong performance in order to transfer from PRS status to full DPhil status. You also need departmental approval of a fully developed research plan, which you will present in your transfer paper to two assessors approved by the department’s graduate studies committee. Within a maximum of four terms as a full-time PRS student or eight terms as a part-time PRS student, you will be expected to apply for and achieve transfer of status from Probationer Research Student to DPhil status. The department’s preference is for Transfer to be completed by the end of the third term (full-time) or sixth term (part-time) in order for students to commence fieldwork during the Trinity Term summer vacation.</p><p>Assessment of progress will be made during sessions with your supervisor and also in more formal viva voce assessments – for the Transfer of Status and for Confirmation of Status (usually at the end of the third year for full-time students and end of the sixth year for part-time students). More information on these two assessments can be found in the course handbook on the ODID website's course page.</p><p>DPhil students submit their thesis for examination three to four years (or six to eight years for part-time) from the date of admissions and defend their thesis in a viva voce examination which takes place between the student and their two appointed examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><blockquote class=\"cis-hide\" style=\"margin: 0 7% 1.5em 1.5em;\"><p>Through the DPhil, I learned critical thinking skills that have guided me in a variety of contexts.

The DTP does not support research focused on human diseases and disease processes or abnormal conditions. The DTP supports research on livestock species and managed land (for example agriculture) and support studies on wild species only when they act as suitable model to provide wider understanding of biological processes.</p><p>The course is led by the University of Oxford in partnership with nine world-class research organisations - the <a href=\"http://www.pirbright.ac.uk/\">Pirbright Institute</a>, which provides the UK’s national capabilities for the study and control of viral diseases of livestock, <a href=\"https://www.brookes.ac.uk/\">Oxford Brookes University</a>, and five research organisations at the <a href=\"http://harwellcampus.com/\">Harwell Campus Oxford</a> (<a href=\"http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home.html\">Diamond Light Source</a>, <a href=\"http://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/\">ISIS Neutron and Muon Source</a>, <a href=\"https://www.clf.stfc.ac.uk/\">STFC Central Laser Facility</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.rc-harwell.ac.uk/\">Research Complex at Harwell</a>), which provide the UK’s national capabilities for synchrotron science, neutron science and laser science, and the new <a href=\"https://www.rfi.ac.uk/\">Rosalind Franklin Institute</a>, which supports the development of new methods for life science research in areas such as imaging, spectroscopy and structural biology.</p><p>The DTP is also partnered with the Novo Nordisk Research Centre Oxford, an innovative target discovery and translational research institute and the <a href=\"https://www.ineosoxford.ox.ac.uk/\">Ineos Oxford Institute</a>, which focuses on tackling the global challenge of anti-microbial resistance. The DTP’s training programme draws on expertise in all nine partner organisations and students will have the opportunity to learn about the facilities and expertise available across these organisations during the initial training phase. All students have a primary supervisor within one of the ten partner organisations, and a secondary supervisor from within the partnership who provides additional support and expertise.</p><p>You will undertake a four-year doctoral training programme. In your first term you are based at the Doctoral Training Centre (DTC) at the University of Oxford and undertake an individually-tailored training programme that includes training in research skills such as mathematics and statistics, programming, imaging and image analysis, bioinformatics, and modelling biological processes and systems. You can also access a wide variety of additional training provided across the partnership throughout your doctoral studies.</p><p>A distinctive feature of the DTP programme is that you are required to undertake a 12-week internship or placement to gain experience of work in a professional environment and in transferable skills that will be beneficial in your future career. Areas that may be explored during internships include industrial research and development, science policy, teaching, science communication, publishing, entrepreneurship and project management.</p><p>You will have the ongoing support of the DTP throughout your studies, including an ongoing training programme in professional skills such as scientific writing, project management, CV writing and interview skills, teaching skills, public engagement and enterprise and entrepreneurship. You can also access specific training in advanced research skills that are relevant to your research interests through specialist training courses, industry-led study groups and practice-led training groups.</p><p>There are a number of different entry routes to the DTP. In addition to the main field of DTP studentships, you can choose to apply to a UKRI-BBSRC supported Industrial (iCASE) studentship, as well as various Partner Studentships.</p><h3 class=\"more-less\">Course features for DTP students (not applicable to Industrial Studentships and Partner Studentships)</h3><p class=\"more-less\">After the initial training phase, you will undertake two 12-week research projects in two different research groups within the partnership, which are tailored to meet the likely requirements of your main doctoral project. You are encouraged to use these rotation projects to further develop your interdisciplinary skills. Following on from the project rotations, you will undertake a three-year doctoral research project with an internationally leading research group and have access to world-class facilities and expertise.</p><h3 class=\"more-less\">Course features for UKRI-BBSRC Industrial (iCASE) and Partner Studentships</h3><p class=\"more-less\">If you apply to the DTP’s Industrial Studentship programme you will have a primary academic supervisor in one of the nine DTP partner organisations and undertake research in collaboration with an industrial or non-academic partner organisation. You will undertake a placement (12 weeks minimum, 18 months maximum) with the industrial partner organisation instead of a 12-week internship to gain experience of work in a non-academic professional environment.</p><p class=\"more-less\">If you apply for a Partner Studentship, at least 50% of your research will be undertaken in close collaboration with a supervisor at one of the DTP's non-University partner organisations (eg Diamond Light Source, Rosalind Franklin Institute, The Pirbright Institute), and you will be co-supervised by a University supervisor. If you undertake a partner studentship with one of the DTP’s partner organisations that does not involve an industrial partner you will undertake a 12-week internship in a non-academic setting.</p><p class=\"more-less\">Partner Studentships may be advertised as specific projects with named supervisors (please see the DTP's website for details of currently available projects) or can be applied for by applying to the main DTP programme and stating your interest in being considered for a partner studentship with a named partner organisation.</p><p class=\"more-less\">Occasionally, the DTP will advertise additional fully-funded studentships with named supervisors within the partnership, depending on the availability of funding. Students recruited to these studentships will be fully integrated into the programme and will participate in DTP training courses and the 12-week internship. They will also normally undertake a 12-week project within a second research group to broaden their network and skills.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Interdisciplinary Bioscience DTP and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff.</p><p>In the first year of the course, DTP students and some Partner students will be supervised by the programme directors, who will also support students in choosing their rotation projects, doctoral research project and supervisory team. Supervision arrangements for years two to four will therefore be confirmed at the end of the first year when the doctoral project is chosen.</p><p>If you are recruited to an Industrial Studentship or to some Partner Studentships or other specific studentships associated with the programme, your supervisor will be known from the outset of your studies and you will work with your supervisor and the programme directors to design and develop your training programme.</p><p>Students on the Partner Studentship programme will have a supervisor at the university at which the student is registered and a supervisor in one of the DTP’s non-university partner organisations (eg Diamond Light Source, The Pirbright Institute).</p><p>Students on the Industrial Studentship programme will have a primary and secondary academic supervisor in one or more of the ten DTP partner organisations, including a supervisor at the university at which the student is registered, and an additional co-supervisor in the company or non-academic organisation that is sponsoring the studentship.</p><p>All DTP students have both a primary supervisor and a co-supervisor with relevant expertise when in the research phase of their DPhil.</p><p>Typically, a student should expect to have meetings with their supervisor or a member of the supervisory team with a frequency of at least once every two weeks averaged across the year when in the research phase of their DPhil. The regularity of these meetings may be subject to variations according to the time of the year, and the stage the student is at in their research programme. They will also normally undertake a 12-week project within a second research group to broaden their network and skills.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>The programme has three milestones to assist you in your progress. You will be required to write a research proposal during the first year of your DPhil, in consultation with your supervisory team, which describes the background literature, aims and rationale for your project, along with a plan of work. This will be assessed by two researchers with relevant expertise to check the suitability and feasibility of the proposed project, along with your understanding of your project. This enables students to receive useful feedback on their proposed project at an early stage. </p><p>The University has two formal milestones to measure your progress, the first being transfer of status, and the second being confirmation of status, which are typically undertaken in the second and third year of your degree respectively. The exact assessment format used will vary according to discipline and department, but each typically involves an assessment of your progress by two researchers with relevant expertise.</p><p>The purpose of the transfer process is to review your project and your plans for future work, to check that you are making satisfactory progress in the development of your project, and to satisfy the assessors that your work is potentially of DPhil quality.</p><p>The purpose of confirmation of status is to provide an indication that if work on the thesis continues to develop satisfactorily, then consideration of submission of the thesis within the time remaining to complete your studies would appear to be reasonable. It therefore provides a second stage of formal progress review. Both you and your supervisors will also be required to reflect and report on your progress at regular intervals using the University’s graduate supervision reporting (GSR) system.</p><p>The final assessment of your work will be based on submission of a written thesis, the exact requirements for which may vary by discipline and department, and through an oral (‘<em>viva voce</em>’) examination, which will be assessed by an internal and external examiner.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>The majority of bioscience graduates from the University of Oxford go into a bioscience-related position after graduation. Many stay in academic research, others work in government, teaching, for charities and within the commercial sector.</p><p>An increasing number of students are exploring and taking up opportunities for entrepreneurship, supported by the training programme in the DTP and the highly entrepreneurial environment within the University and across Oxfordshire as a whole. Others are pursuing careers in emerging fields such as data science, building on the computational and analytical skills they develop during their doctoral work. </p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

The discoveries and inventions of immunologists have led to worldwide successes in vaccination, immunotherapy, transplantation and immunodiagnostics.", "about": "<div class=\"field-item even\"><div id=\"content-tab\"><p>The aim of the taught MSc in Integrated Immunology (Part-time) is to provide students with a stimulating and comprehensive education, high-quality research training and the professional skills required for a rewarding career in modern immunology. This part-time postgraduate course is delivered online over two years, with a one-week residential component in Oxford towards the end of the first year of study. The course is aimed at those who wish to study the exciting subject of immunology at a world-class institution, but who are not able to relocate to Oxford to study full-time in-person. We particularly welcome exceptional candidates from underprivileged, challenging or unconventional backgrounds, those residing in low- and middle-income countries, and those with caring or professional responsibilities.</p><h3>Structure and Content</h3><p>The part-time online MSc in Integrated Immunology explores immunology in breadth and depth and is intended for science and medical postgraduates. It is a 24-month, part-time course comprising two taught units followed by an extended research project typically hosted by a University of Oxford research group. The first taught unit focuses on the fundamental science of immunology. This is taught over Michaelmas and Hilary terms of the first academic year. The second unit explores the applied, clinical and therapeutic aspects of immunology, and is taught over Trinity term and the long vacation of the first year. The third unit research project takes place over the second year of study, beginning in Michaelmas term and ending during Trinity term.</p><p>Taught units are each delivered across a series of five linked topic themes to ensure holistic coverage of modern immunology.</p><p>Course content includes:</p><h4>Unit 1 Scientific Principles of Immunology taught themes:</h4><ul><li>Fundamentals in immunology</li><li>Innate immunity and inflammation</li><li>Antigen presentation and recognition</li><li>Adaptive immunity</li><li>Evolution of human immunity</li></ul><h4>Unit 2 Clinical and Applied Principles of Immunology taught themes:</h4><ul><li>Infection &amp; immunity</li><li>Failure of immunity</li><li>Aberrant or unwanted immunity</li><li>Cancer immunology</li><li>Manipulation of immunity</li></ul><h4>Unit 3 Experimental Principles of Immunology:</h4><ul><li>Research project</li></ul><h3>Teaching and Learning</h3><p>The course is designed to support you with flexible part-time study, therefore, written, recorded and interactive materials are accessible asynchronously, allowing you to study at a time that suits you. The class will meet ‘live’ online, typically at fortnightly intervals during taught units. Pre-recorded lectures are given by speakers drawn from the University of Oxford Immunology Network, Oxford University Hospitals or external institutions. During the third unit you will undertake a desk-based remote project with staff affiliated to a top-ranked research department or institute across the Medical Sciences Division. Oxford has one of the highest concentrations of research-active immunologists in the world; students on this MSc course are therefore uniquely placed to benefit from this wealth of expertise.</p><p>Within taught units, topic themes each last between two and four weeks. In an average teaching week, students usually watch three to four pre-recorded lectures and complete related reading and asynchronous interactive activities. Each topic theme includes one or two synchronous ‘live’ online small group discussions, collaborative activities or problem-based learning sessions, which are led by tutors or students. Continuing professional development classes, including in scientific skills, careers and special research seminars take place throughout both taught terms. Self-directed study is also required alongside structured teaching. In the third term you will undertake an original, supervised research project to gain a working understanding of research techniques in immunology or a related area. Research supervisors provide regular support and guidance during the course of the desk-based project, and students are normally expected to work on their projects part-time during the week, or as agreed with their supervisor.</p><p>On average, over the units of study during the course term time we would expect students to devote an average of 12 hours per week to their studies.</p><p>A one-week residential is included as part of the course and is held in Oxford at the end of the first year of study. This will include special seminars and other academic activities, opportunities for professional networking and time to explore your college and the wonderful city of Oxford. This will include social events with your fellow students and the course team.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences.<br/>The Course Director will be your primary supervisor throughout the course. They typically have close contact with the class during the first two terms, and will meet regularly with students to discuss their progress. In the third term day-to-day supervision is devolved to the project supervisor, however the Course Director remains available to meet with students and will continue to monitor their progress.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>By the end of the course students should be able to clearly demonstrate their understanding of how the fundamental principles of immunology integrate with the clinical aspects of immune-driven disease, and with other relevant bioscience disciplines.

However, the MSc in Integrated Immunology (Part-time) has run continuously since 2004 as a full-time in-person program in Oxford. Over those years, about half of our alumni from the MSc have gone on to graduate research degrees, with a number of those taking up DPhil positions in Oxford. Approximately a third of alumni from the MSc have continued to medical school, or progressed to higher specialist medical training. Others have taken up positions the pharmaceutical, biotechnology or corporate sectors as senior scientists, policy advisors, analysts and managers. We anticipate that students on our part-time course will follow similar career paths to become part of the global network of immunologists.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

It is a 12-month, full-time course comprising two 11-week taught terms followed by a 14-week research project within a University of Oxford research group. The first taught term focuses on the fundamental science of immunology, while the second explores the applied, clinical and therapeutic aspects of immunology. This MSc course is not modular in structure; all elements are compulsory for all students. Teaching is delivered across a series of linked topic themes to ensure holistic coverage of modern immunology. By the end of the course students should be able to demonstrate their understanding of how the fundamental principles of immunology integrates with the clinical aspects of immune-driven disease and with other disciplines including cell and molecular biology, genetics and microbiology.</p><p>You will be taught by leading academics in immunology throughout the first two terms of the course. You will hear from a wide range of different lecturers, drawn from the University of Oxford Immunology Network, Oxford University Hospitals or external institutions. In the third term you you will undertake a project in a top-ranked research department or institute. MSc projects are provided by internationally-recognised research groups across the Medical Sciences Division. Oxford has one of the highest concentrations of research-active immunologists in the world. Students on this MSc course are therefore uniquely placed to benefit from this wealth of expertise.</p><p>Each of the two 11-week taught terms consist of nine weeks of classroom-based teaching, one for revision and one for examination. An average teaching week comprises approximately seven lectures, each lecture being 60 to 90 minutes in duration. In addition, there are small-group discussion and problem-based learning sessions, which may be led by tutors, or by students. Continuing professional development classes, including on presentation and IT skills, statistics, ethics, scientific methodologies, careers and special seminars take place throughout both taught terms. Self-directed study is required alongside structured teaching. In the third term you will undertake an original, supervised research project to gain a working understanding of research techniques in immunology or a related area. Research supervisors provide regular support and guidance during the course of the research project, and students are normally expected to work on their projects during core working hours during the week, or as agreed with their supervisor.</p><p>Students are expected to treat their studies as a full-time occupation of at least 40-hours per week.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences.</p><p>The Course Director will be your primary supervisor throughout the course. They typically have close contact with the class during the first two terms, and will meet regularly with students to discuss their progress. In the third term day-to-day supervision is devolved to the project supervisor, however the Course Director remains available to meet with students should they wish to.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>At the end of each taught term, you will take a computer-based examination to test core knowledge.

In the early 1970s, the creation of the chair of the history of science and the establishment of the Wellcome Unit for the History of Medicine gave the subject additional strength and allowed important new departures. The <a href=\"https://www.hsmt.ox.ac.uk/home\">Oxford Centre for the History of Science, Medicine and Technology (HSMT)</a> was created in 2017 in order to build on the teaching and research capacity of the numerous historians working on HSMT subjects in Oxford-based projects and in various museums, colleges and faculties.</p><p>The expertise of scholars in Oxford covers most of the main areas and periods of the history of science, medicine, and technology.

Topics will include the relationship between art and mass culture; modernism’s affiliations with both reactionary and revolutionary ideologies of the ‘popular’; the gendering of modern art in period accounts and in later art historical narratives; the connections between modernism and French colonialism; and the encounter with African art and myths of the ‘primitive’. To explore these issues, the writings of artists and their contemporaries will be examined alongside recent art-historical work and a range of theoretical texts on questions relevant to the materials of the course.</p><h3 class=\"more-less\">Gothic to Renaissance? Reframing Architecture in Europe and Beyond</h3><p class=\"more-less\">Tutor: Dr Costanza Beltrami</p><p class=\"more-less\">The Gothic and the Renaissance have long been viewed as two distinct artistic periods or ‘styles’ in neat succession. But what are the chronological, geographical, and conceptual limits of Gothic and Renaissance architecture? What happens if we recast late-Gothic architecture as a global phenomenon of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries?</p><p class=\"more-less\">In addition to canonical examples from England, France, and Germany, late-Gothic buildings were erected (and decorated) in newly conquered territories such as the Canary Islands, Madeira, and Santo Domingo. In their materials and decorations, these new foundations responded to local contexts, in spite of being based on models brought from overseas. As the Gothic and other European traditions became global phenomena, they were increasingly in competition with new Renaissance designs. Architecture thus embodies a complex process of cultural interweaving: innovative late-Gothic buildings continued to appear at the height of the Renaissance; master masons constructed dynamic hybrids of different architectural modes; and linear conceptions of influence from the Italian ‘centre’ to global peripheries are dispelled by the intensity of artistic exchanges.</p><p class=\"more-less\">Challenging the perception of the Renaissance as a watershed in the emergence of architectural and cultural modernity, this course will place Gothic and Renaissance buildings not in opposition, but in dialogue. Uniquely, it will invite associations and conversations which are still relatively unexplored in architectural history. We will examine issues of reuse, communication, adaptation, exchange, and hybridisation on continental and intercontinental scales. Additionally, we will take into account the international trade networks where raw materials and luxury artworks were exported and imported, as well as the structures which enabled and enshrined commercial and territorial domination. Finally, we will study both religious and secular structures as lived-in, multi-media creations at the heart of networks of production and communication. This approach to architecture will enable students to develop personal research interests in other media, such as micro-architecture, sculpture or drawing.</p><h3 class=\"more-less\">Histories of Photography</h3><p class=\"more-less\">Tutor: Professor Geoffrey Batchen, Professor of History of Art</p><p class=\"more-less\">Participants in this seminar class will be invited to write a version of their own history of photography. The class will begin by looking at the history of that history, and will then consider various alternatives to it. Attention will be paid to the problems of writing such a history, a quite particular challenge given the mobility and reproducibility of the photograph, and thus its reluctance to adhere to the usual art historical categories (originality, medium specificity, chronology, nationalism, biography, style, genre, and so on). Each of these ways of doing art history will nevertheless be considered, and equivalent photographic examples critically analysed. Case studies to be considered include histories of the photography produced in Africa and in the British Empire. Participants will be asked to write research essays that demonstrate their own approach to a particular kind of history of photography.</p><h3 class=\"more-less\">Global Perspectives on American Art: Latinx Art and Activism</h3><p class=\"more-less\">Tutor: Charlene Villaseñor Black, Terra Foundation Visiting Professor of American Art</p><p class=\"more-less\">This course expands the definition of “American” art by examining art created by minoritized populations in the US, with a particular focus on Latinx art in the 20th Century. The class begins by querying the definition of “American” art, the inclusion of Latinx art in the canon, and the evolving terminology employed in its study (including the “x” as indicative of both gender inclusivity and indigeneity). Latinx art has always manifested an uneasy relationship with mainstream artistic institutions - the museum, art history, art criticism. As a public art created in opposition to established elite institutions such as the museum, as well as a popular art that admits low riders and home altars as the objects of scholarly study, Latinx art raises important questions about the very nature of art history and criticism. This class will focus on 20th-century Latinx cultural production and its relationship to activism, with a particular focus on alternative cultural spaces. Topics to be considered include prints, murals, photography, sculpture, and performance in light of theories of decoloniality, feminism, the Neobaroque, rasquache aesthetics, and global modernisms/postmodernisms.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Department of History of Art and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under some circumstances a supervisor outside the Department of History of Art may be nominated. </p><p>Supervisors will meet with their students weekly in Michaelmas and Hilary terms to teach the option paper, and will also offer at least five hours dedicated supervision for the dissertation. </p><p>An Oxford academic’s pre-application indication of willingness to supervise an enquiring applicant is not a guarantee that the applicant will be offered a place, or that the supervisor in question has capacity in that particular year.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>You will write a dissertation under the guidance of an expert supervisor, on a topic of your choice and approved by the supervisor and the chair of examiners for the programme. The dissertation is submitted in Trinity term.</p><p>In addition to the dissertation, assessment will take the form of exams and assessed essays. For the compulsory methodology paper you will write three short essays in an examination.</p><p>The option paper is assessed through one short methodological or historiographic essay and one research project. Students receive one-on-one supervision when preparing their essays.</p><p>If you wish to apply for a doctoral programme, at Oxford or elsewhere, you will be encouraged to develop your doctoral proposal during the first few months of the course so that you will be well placed to make doctoral applications during or soon after completing the course.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>About a quarter of master’s students proceed directly to doctoral work at Oxford or at other institutions, with additional students applying to doctoral programmes within a year or two of completing the degree. Other career destinations include museums and galleries, the heritage sector, media/publishing (including online), fine arts and teaching, as well as fields such as banking, law and the civil service.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

Within a maximum of four terms as a full-time PRS student or eight terms as a part-time PRS student, you will be expected to apply for transfer of status from Probationer Research Student to DPhil status. This application is normally made in the second term for full-time students and by the fifth term for part-time students.</p><p>A successful transfer of status from PRS to DPhil status will require a statement, a piece of written work and the support of your supervisor. Students who are successful at transfer will also be expected to apply for and gain confirmation of DPhil status to show that your work continues to be on track. This will need to done within nine terms of admission for full-time students and eighteen terms of admission for part-time students.</p><p>Both milestones normally involve an interview with one or two assessors (other than your supervisor) and therefore provide important experience for the final oral examination.</p><p>Full-time students will be expected to submit a thesis of not more than 100,000 words after three or, at most, four years from the date of admission.

If you are thinking about applying for a DPhil researching economic and social history, you should consider whether your proposed topic falls within the remit of economic and social history or whether it would be more appropriate to apply for the DPhil in History.</p><p>If studying full-time, you will be expected to submit your dissertation three, or at most four, years from the date of admission. If studying part-time, you will be expected to submit your dissertation six, or at most eight, years from the date of admission. <br/> <br/>You will be expected to attend and to contribute to two weekly research seminars: the Tuesday Evening Research Seminar and the Wednesday Lunchtime Graduate Student Seminar. You will also be expected to attend the Annual Graduate Workshop in Economic and Social History in the first week of Trinity term, at which MSc and MPhil students present their dissertation projects. You are strongly encouraged to participate in the wide range of other research seminars, conferences and workshops organised by the faculty and the division. Your supervisor will advise you on which seminars will be most beneficial for your chosen research area. You will also have access to specialist training courses offered by the Bodleian Libraries and IT Services. You can attend any lectures, across the University, that you wish to (subject to any specific restrictions), and we encourage students to take advantage of this and explore areas outside their specific research topic.</p><h3>Further information about studying part time</h3><p>The faculty is able to offer the DPhil in full-time as well as part-time mode of attendance. Please note that any published statistics as regards acceptance rates are not an indication of applicants having a better chance of acceptance in part-time mode. All DPhil applications are assessed together and compared with each other, irrespective of the mode of study.</p><p>The faculty's research degrees are not available by distance learning. Although there will be no requirement to reside in Oxford, part-time research students must attend the University on a regular basis (particularly in term-time: October and November, mid-January to mid-March, and late April to mid-June) for supervision, study, research seminars and skills training. The dates of attendance will be determined by mutual agreement with your supervisor.</p><p>We cannot sponsor student visas for part-time study as the study patterns are not compatible with Home Office regulations on attendance monitoring. However, other options may be available and you should contact the <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#dbbca9babfaebaafbef5babfb6b2a8a8b2b4b5a89bb3b2a8afb4a9a2f5b4a3f5bab8f5aeb0\">admissions</a> office to discuss.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Faculty of History and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Offers will only be made if appropriate supervision is available. Offers will only be made if appropriate supervision is available.</p><p>It is usual practice that DPhil students have one supervisor, but a co-supervisor will be appointed if additional specialist knowledge is required. For the DPhil in Economic and Social History, a sole supervisor outside the Faculty of History (eg the Department of Economics) may be nominated. In exceptional circumstances, a co-supervisor from outside the university may be appointed. </p><p>Your supervisor(s) is there to provide advice, guidance, and support throughout your DPhil. You should meet your supervisor(s) early in your first term to establish a clear framework for your research and writing, and identify any skills training needed to undertake your research. It is up to you and your supervisor to decide on the frequency of future meetings. In the first year, you should meet your supervisor at least twice a term, and keep in frequent contact. As you become more engaged with your research, you may meet your supervisor less frequently, but you should maintain regular contact with them.</p><p>Your supervisor or supervisors will help you develop a programme of research and writing. You will also benefit from the advice and support of other members of the faculty who will be involved in your progression through the transfer and confirmation stages of the degree, and you will be able to draw on the expertise of scholars and colleagues throughout the faculty and University.</p><p>Please note that if you have contacted a potential supervisor prior to submitting your application, any indication made by an academic that they may be willing to supervise a potential project, is not a guarantee that you will be offered a place, or that the supervisor in question has capacity to supervise you in that particular year.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>All students will be initially admitted to the status of Probationer Research Student (PRS). Within a maximum of four terms as a full-time PRS student, or eight terms as a part-time PRS student, you will be expected to apply for transfer of status from Probationer Research Student to DPhil status. This application is normally made by the second term for full-time students and by the fifth term for part-time students.</p><p>A successful transfer of status from PRS to DPhil status will require the submission of a thesis outline and a piece of written work. Students who are successful at transfer will also be expected to apply for and gain confirmation of DPhil status to show that your work continues to be on track. This will need to done within nine terms of admission for full-time students and eighteen terms of admission for part-time students.</p><p>Both milestones normally involve an interview with one or two assessors (other than your supervisor) and therefore provide and important experience for the final oral examination.</p><p>Full-time students will be expected to submit a substantial thesis of not more than 100,000 words after three or, at most, four years from the date of admission. If you are studying part-time, you will be required to submit your thesis after six or, at most, eight years from the date of admission. To be successfully awarded a DPhil in History (Economic and Social History) you will need to defend your thesis orally (<em>viva voce</em>) in front of two appointed examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Approximately half of students who complete their doctoral thesis go on to further academic posts worldwide. Some work as freelance historians, others are in professional administrative positions in areas such as finance, the civil service, university administration, banking, and publishing.

You will also have access to specialist training courses offered by the Bodleian Libraries and IT Services. Your supervisor will advise you on what seminars will be more beneficial for your chosen research area. You can attend any lectures, across the University, that you wish to (subject to any specific restrictions), and we encourage students to take advantage of this and explore areas outside of their specific research topic.</p><h3>Further information about studying part time</h3><p>The faculty is able to offer the DPhil in History in full-time as well as part-time mode of attendance. Please note that any published statistics as regards acceptance rates are not an indication of applicants having a better chance of acceptance in part-time mode. All DPhil applications are assessed together and compared with each other, irrespective of the mode of study. </p><p>The faculty's research degrees are not available by distance learning. Although there will be no requirement to reside in Oxford, part-time research students must attend the University on a regular basis (particularly in term-time: October and November, mid-January to mid-March, and late April to mid-June) for supervision, study, research seminars and skills training, to ensure a comprehensive integration into the faculty's and University's research culture and with their full-time peer groups. The dates of attendance will be determined by mutual agreement with your supervisor. </p><p>We cannot sponsor student visas for part-time study as the study patterns are not compatible with Home Office regulations on attendance monitoring.

Offers will only be made if appropriate supervision is available.</p><p>It is usual practice that DPhil students have one supervisor, but a co-supervisor will be appointed if additional specialist knowledge is required. One supervisor must be a permanent member of the Faculty of History, but a co-supervisor can be appointed from a different department. In exceptional circumstances, a co-supervisor from outside the university may be appointed. </p><p>Please note that if you have contacted a potential supervisor prior to submitting your application, any indication made by an academic that they may be willing to supervise a potential project, is not a guarantee that you will be offered a place, or that the supervisor in question has capacity to supervise you in that particular year.</p><p>Your supervisor(s) is there to provide advice, guidance, and support throughout your DPhil. You should meet your supervisor(s) early in your first term to establish a clear framework for your research and writing, and identify any skills training needed to undertake your research. It is up to you and your supervisor to decide on the frequency of future meetings. In the first year, you should meet your supervisor at least twice a term, and keep in frequent contact. As you become more engaged with your research, you may meet your supervisor less frequently, but you should maintain regular contact with them.</p><p>You will also benefit from the advice and support of other members of the faculty who will be involved in your progression through the transfer and confirmation stages of the degree, and you will be able to draw on the expertise of scholars and colleagues throughout the wider university.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>All students will be initially admitted to the status of Probationer Research Student (PRS). Within a maximum of four terms as a full-time PRS student, or eight terms as a part-time PRS student, you will be expected to apply for transfer of status from Probationer Research Student to DPhil status. This application is normally made by the second term for full-time students and by the fifth term for part-time students.</p><p>A successful transfer of status from PRS to DPhil status will require the submission of a thesis outline and a piece of written work. Students who are successful at transfer will also be expected to apply for and gain confirmation of DPhil status to show that your work continues to be on track. This will need to done within nine terms of admission for full-time students and eighteen terms of admission for part-time students.</p><p>Both milestones normally involve an interview with one or two assessors (other than your supervisor) and therefore provide and important experience for the final oral examination.</p><p>Full-time students will be expected to submit a substantial thesis of not more than 100,000 words after three or, at most, four years from the date of admission. If you are studying part-time, you will be required to submit your thesis after six or, at most, eight years from the date of admission. To be successfully awarded a DPhil in History you will need to defend your thesis orally (<em>viva voce</em>) in front of two appointed examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Approximately half of students who complete their doctoral thesis go on to further academic posts worldwide.

You also have access to specialist training courses offered by the Bodleian Libraries and IT Services.</p><h3>Further information about studying part time</h3><p>The faculty is able to offer the programme in full-time as well as part-time mode of attendance. Please note that any published statistics as regards acceptance rates are not an indication of applicants having a better chance of acceptance in part-time mode. All DPhil applications are assessed together and compared with each other, irrespective of the mode of study.</p><p>History of Art research degrees are not available by distance learning. Although there will be no requirement to reside in Oxford, part-time research students must attend the University on a regular basis in term-time: October and November, mid-January to mid-March, and late April to mid-June. Part-time students are required to attend seminars, skills training and supervision meetings in Oxford. The dates of attendance will be determined by mutual agreement with your supervisor.</p><p>We cannot sponsor student visas for part-time study as the study patterns are not compatible with Home Office regulations on attendance monitoring. However, other options may be available and you should contact the <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#187f6a797c6d796c7d36797c75716b6b7177766b5870716b6c776a6136776036797b366d73\">admissions</a> office to discuss.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Department of History of Art, and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under some circumstances a supervisor outside the Department of History of Art may be nominated.</p><p>All students for the DPhil in History of Art will be supported by a supervisor or supervisors who will help them develop a programme of research and writing. You will also benefit from the advice and support of other members of the department who will be involved in the progression of students through the transfer and confirmation stages of the degree, and can draw on the expertise of scholars and colleagues throughout the faculty and University.</p><p>It will be up to you and your supervisor to decide on the frequency of meetings, though generally speaking in the first year you should plan to meet them at least every few weeks during term time, and keep in frequent contact. As you become more engaged with your research, you may meet your supervisor less frequently, but you are encouraged to maintain regular contact with them.</p><p>Please note that if you have contacted a potential supervisor prior to submitting your application, any indication made by an academic that they may be willing to supervise a potential project, is not a guarantee that you will be offered a place or that the supervisor in question has capacity to supervise you in that particular year. </p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>All students will be initially admitted to the status of Probationer Research Student (PRS). Within a maximum of four terms as a full-time PRS student or eight terms as a part-time PRS student, you will be expected to apply for transfer of status from Probationer Research Student to DPhil status. This application is normally made in the second term for full-time students and by the fifth term for part-time students.</p><p>A successful transfer of status from PRS to DPhil status will require a statement, a piece of written work and the support of your supervisor. Students who are successful at transfer will also be expected to apply for and gain confirmation of DPhil status to show that your work continues to be on track. This will need to done within nine terms of admission for full-time students and eighteen terms of admission for part-time students.</p><p>Both milestones normally involve an interview with one or two assessors (other than your supervisor) and therefore provide important experience for the final oral examination.</p><p>Full-time students will be expected to submit a thesis of not more than 100,000 words after three or, at most, four years from the date of admission. If you are studying part-time, you will be required to submit your thesis after six or, at most, eight years from the date of admission.</p><p>To be successfully awarded a DPhil in History of Art you will need to defend your thesis orally (<em>viva voce</em>) in front of two appointed examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>A number of doctoral students in the history of art have gone on to academic teaching or research positions, have gained Junior Research Fellowships and other postdoctoral awards, or are producing work as independent scholars. Many now occupy a variety of senior roles in international museums and galleries. Other career destinations include teaching, conservation, TV production, auction houses and law.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

You will be taught both in, usually weekly or fortnightly, one-on-one supervision sessions (in particular for the dissertation and for the text options), and in (typically weekly) classes, and will yourself drive the direction of your studies. You also have the opportunity to attend a wide range of lectures, seminars and talks by visiting speakers.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>Assessment for text options is by two essays, submitted either in Hilary or Trinity (ie second or third) term, and a translation exam in Trinity term. Skills-based options are assessed either by exam or by pre-submitted work, or by a combination of the two. The dissertation is submitted in Trinity term.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Many MSt graduates go on to take doctorates, either in Oxford or elsewhere. Many subsequently take up university teaching or research posts after finishing their doctorates. Those who do not take doctorates go into a variety of occupations, including teaching, publishing, administration, business and other professions. We have a Sub-Faculty Placement Officer, and the University Careers Office provides help for classicists.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

However, the MPhil is often taken by two groups of students and designed with them in mind: those who feel that they would benefit from two more years of taught education in Classics before embarking on a doctorate; and those who have a clear idea of the topic that they hope to research eventually for their doctorate, and who wish to start extensive work on this topic already in their master's dissertation.</p><p>Most students take the course as preparation for a research degree, and for such students it might offer, for instance, linguistic training; the opportunity to become acquainted with an ancillary discipline such as papyrology; engagement with a particular author's texts at a deeper level; and/or textual criticism of Greek and/or Latin; or, reception studies. The MPhil also offers, through an obligatory dissertation, the first steps in actual research and the extended presentation of a scholarly argument.</p><p>You will study three options: a thesis and any two options from lists A and B. You will study one option in your first year and the other in your second year, and will work on your thesis across both years.</p><p>List A comprises major literary texts and genres - for example, historiography, lyric poetry, Cicero, Ovid. You may also devise your own option, subject to approval of your set of texts. The core of the teaching for these options is a series of, typically fortnightly, one-on-one sessions with a tutor.</p><p>List B comprises more technical subjects such as the textual criticism of Greek or Latin texts, papyrology, comparative philology and reception. These options are delivered in a variety of ways, often by (typically weekly) classes. Intermediate Ancient Greek or Latin may be taken if you have not studied both languages to a high level in the course of your first degree.</p><p>There is the possibility of specialising in reception across the course by choosing the Reception module option and working on reception topics in a text/genre option, though you will still sit a translation exam as detailed below.</p><p>All MPhil students have the opportunity to attend a wide range of lectures, seminars and talks by visiting speakers. In their first year, they also attend a class on research techniques in Classical literature, extending over two to three terms. This looks at aspects of Classical scholarship and its history, and includes direct viewing of papyri, manuscripts, vases, and other resources in Oxford. In the second and third term considerable attention is paid to presentational skills, as students deliver papers of their own to each other.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>As an MPhil student you are assigned a supervisor, who provides overall direction for your course, and with whom you have regular meetings.

As you become more engaged with your research, you may meet your supervisor less frequently, but you should maintain regular contact with them.</p><p>You will also benefit from the advice and support of other members of the faculty who will be involved in your progression through the transfer and confirmation stages of the degree, and you will be able to draw on the expertise of scholars and colleagues throughout the wider university.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>All students will be initially admitted to the status of Probationer Research Student (PRS). Within a maximum of four terms as a full-time PRS student, or eight terms as a part-time PRS student, you will be expected to apply for transfer of status from Probationer Research Student to DPhil status. This application is normally made by the second term for full-time students and by the fifth term for part-time students.</p><p>A successful transfer of status from PRS to DPhil status will require the submission of a thesis outline and a piece of written work. Students who are successful at transfer will also be expected to apply for and gain confirmation of DPhil status to show that your work continues to be on track. This will need to done within nine terms of admission for full-time students and eighteen terms of admission for part-time students.</p><p>Both milestones normally involve an interview with one or two assessors (other than your supervisor) and therefore provide and important experience for the final oral examination.</p><p>Full-time students will be expected to submit a substantial thesis of not more than 100,000 words after three or, at most, four years from the date of admission. If you are studying part-time, you will be required to submit your thesis after six or, at most, eight years from the date of admission. To be successfully awarded a DPhil in History you will need to defend your thesis orally (<em>viva voce</em>) in front of two appointed examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Approximately half of students who complete their doctoral thesis go on to further academic posts worldwide.

Students will receive 15-20 hours of supported learning per week, and will be expected to undertake 20-25 hours of self-directed learning per week.</p><h3>Course Structure</h3><h4>Core modules</h4><p>The first term will consist of an overview of the global burden of disease and the fundamental concepts and considerations in research methods and practice related to population health:</p><ul><li>Introduction to Global Health Science</li><li>Principles of Epidemiology</li><li>Principles of Statistics</li><li>International Research Ethics</li></ul><h4>Option modules</h4><p>During the second term and up to two weeks in the third term, in addition to some continued content of the compulsory modules, students will select four of the following eight module options for further study:</p><ul><li>Clinical Trials and Meta-analysis</li><li>Communicable Disease Epidemiology</li><li>Genetic Epidemiology</li><li>Health Economics</li><li>Maternal and Child Health</li><li>Non-communicable Diseases</li><li>Nutritional Epidemiology</li><li>Principles and Applications of Data Science</li></ul><h4>Placement Project and Dissertation</h4><p>The third term will involve a 12-week research placement with a project representing the range of subjects covered in the course. The department will have a series of projects to choose from each year, hosted by academics within and outside the department but students can also propose their own project. The research project will form the basis of a 10,000-word dissertation to be submitted in mid-August.</p><h4>Masterclasses</h4><p>A series of regular 'master-classes' is scheduled in which internationally-recognised senior scientists in population health from Oxford, and elsewhere, will give seminars on selected topics. These sessions will be outside of the structure of the core modules, and are intended to provide the students with stimulating materials to integrate population health thinking and perspectives.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Nuffield Department of Population Health and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Nuffield Department of Population Health.</p><p>Each student will be assigned an academic supervisor who will support them through the duration of the course. Students will also have a placement supervisor related to their chosen placement who will meet with them regularly throughout their placement.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>During the first two terms there are a series of formative assessments designed to enable teaching staff to monitor student progress. These assessments are compulsory but the marks do not contribute to the final degree. All students are provided with detailed feedback that will enable them to improve their learning by helping them identify their strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>There are eight summative assessments in total. The global health reports (7.5% each) are submitted through the academic year, in relation to when modules are taught. At the end of the Easter break a data set analysis and report (10%) is submitted. At the beginning of the third term (week two), there are two written examinations – one on the Principles of Epidemiology and the other on the Principles of Statistics, comprising multi-component questions (10% each). Following submission of all summative assessments, students will undertake a research placement, leading to a dissertation (40%) to be submitted in mid-August.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>The MSc Global Health Science and Epidemiology prepares students to establish careers in academia (by pursuing doctoral studies), major national and international health organisations, government agencies, or in industry.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

Students from all cohorts (and their supervisors) will gather for a scientific meeting exploring a range of fusion issues and how they link to related fields, such as fission, advanced instrumentation, technological plasmas, and more.</p><p>The remaining three years of the full-time programme (six years if studying part-time) will be spent conducting research. A wide range of exciting <a href=\"https://www.materials.ox.ac.uk/admissions/postgraduate/newprojects.html\">DPhil projects </a>is available and they are listed on the Department of Materials website under <em>Fusion Power DPhil projects</em>.</p><h3>Fusion materials research at the University of Oxford</h3><p>Research interests in Oxford's Department of Materials extend over most branches of materials science, as well as some aspects of solid state physics and chemistry. These include the study of a wide range of materials of relevance in advanced technological applications, including metals and alloys, composites, semi- and super-conductors, polymers, biomaterials, ceramics and materials for quantum information processing.</p><p>Much of the research is carried out in close collaboration with industry. World-leading research takes place on:</p><ul><li>the characterisation of materials, where there is emphasis on electron microscopy and related techniques</li><li>processing and manufacturing of materials</li><li>modelling of materials, where there is attention to both structures and processes</li><li>properties of materials</li><li>energy materials, including those for batteries, nuclear fusion and photovoltaics</li><li>quantum information processing, which includes groups working on experimental studies, theory and modelling.</li></ul><p>The plasma-facing components and breeding blanket of any future fusion tokamak will be subjected to one of the most extreme engineering environments possible. Materials will experience temperatures of up to 1200C in steady state and 3300C in transient events, and irradiation with 14MeV neutrons, causing displacement damage, transmutation giving rise to compositional changes, and internal H and He generation, plasma facing surfaces also can have  high erosion rates due to interactions with the fusion plasma. Ideally, the materials should not retain tritium or themselves transmute to long-lived radioactive isotopes. For fusion to be feasible as an economic power source, the materials must be able to survive these conditions, retaining usable thermal and mechanical properties, for five years or more.</p><p>Materials of current interest include special 'reduced activation' steels, tungsten alloys and composites, ceramic composites for neutron shielding, silicon carbide and high-temperature superconductors.</p><p>The University offers a range of projects, both experimental and modelling, on the processing, joining, microstructure, mechanical properties, and resistance to radiation damage of these materials.</p><p>Projects will use a range of specialised research techniques, usually in combination:</p><ul><li>advanced processing, coating and joining methods (mechanical alloying, rapid solidification, spray forming, additive manufacture, friction-stir welding)</li><li>irradiation of materials by high-energy ion-beams, protons and neutrons.</li><li>liquid metal corrosion</li><li>characterisation of superconducting materials</li><li>electron microscopy of microstructures, and radiation damage effects, including in-situ irradiations, and field-ion microscopy of radiation damage</li><li>microanalysis by atom-probe tomography and electron-optical methods</li><li>X-ray diffraction including use of the diamond light source mechanical testing, including micromechanics, over a wide temperature range</li><li>computer modelling of radiation damage effects, deformation and microstructural development.</li></ul><p>An overview of the provision for research students in the Department of Materials can be found at the <a href=\"http://www.materials.ox.ac.uk/teaching/pg/researchprovision.html\">Summary of Provision for Materials Research Students</a> webpage.

You will be part of a small cohort on a course designed to direct and develop your artistic practice and theoretical knowledge in a supportive environment. The MFA provides an outstanding artistic environment for developing your practice in the context of a postgraduate, arts research culture.", "about": "<div class=\"field-item even\"><div id=\"content-tab\"><p>The tutorial system is at the heart of teaching on the MFA and you will be supported by tutors of the highest calibre, with a student-to-staff ratio and contact time that are exceptional in UK art schools. The light and spacious MFA studios are located on the first floor of Ruskin's Bullingdon Road building, with easy access to workshops and media facilities downstairs.</p><p>The programme encompasses a diversity of disciplines including painting, sculpture, printmaking, photography, writing, installation, video, sound, performance, and other expanded forms in contemporary art. It aims to encourage experimentation and nurture a critical focus for your work.</p><p>Your artistic interests and those of your peers will be embedded in tutorials, seminars, and presentations, determining the direction of your creative development. You will engage with what it means to work as an artist today, considering how an artist’s work and ideas register in different social, artistic, historical, and theoretical contexts. You will be guided and supported by tutors in regular one-to-one tutorials and weekly seminars, focused on your making, key concerns, ideas, and their interdependent development.</p><p>Studio-based learning is facilitated through regular group reflection, which is characterised by collective participation in generous and robust discussion. A programme of dedicated masterclasses and skills workshops is designed specifically for the MFA. Facilities, such as the media lab and editing suites, printmaking workshop, casting, metal, and wood workshops, are on site in the Bullingdon Road building (https://www.rsa.ox.ac.uk/study/resources).</p><p>Ruskin students benefit from being part of a large University, with access to lectures and seminars in other departments and colleges and to specialist libraries and collections. The city’s varied cultural organisations include the Ashmolean Museum, Pitt Rivers Museum, and Modern Art Oxford, and students can freely access the Botanical Gardens and many other green spaces in and around Oxford.</p><p>The MFA is built around three compact eight-week terms, with students expected to continue working through the winter and spring breaks. A typical week on the MFA during the first two terms (Michaelmas and Hilary) includes: a half day research or practice seminar, an individual tutorial, and a skills workshop or masterclass.</p><p>The rest of your time on the course is dedicated to independent study: artistic practice and research in the studio, utilising Ruskin’s workshops and facilities and using the libraries. At the end of second term (Hilary), you will submit an Extended Text in support of the studio project. The last term (Trinity) is focused on the preparation of artwork for the final exhibition and a digital portfolio of studio practice for examination. MFA students and staff work together to curate and install the degree show in the MFA space at Bullingdon Road, which opens at the end of term.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Ruskin School of Art and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff.</p><p>MFA students see their allocated Studio Practice tutor and their allocated Extended Text tutor regularly for individual and group tutorials throughout the year. Meetings with tutors happen three times a term at the minimum.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>The MFA has three main modes of assessment:</p><h4>Final Exhibition</h4><p>A presentation of fully realised artwork, or body of works, made during the MFA programme. This requires students to develop, create and present a coherent, thoughtful installation of work within a group exhibition.</p><h4>Portfolio of Studio Practice</h4><p>A digital portfolio of studio practice documented by photographic or other means. Throughout the programme, students are encouraged to construct approaches to documentation appropriate to their practice and research.</p><h4>Extended Text</h4><p>A written text of 4-6,000 words in support of the studio project. Students are encouraged to take an experimental approach to writing as they develop an account of the methodology used in the final project, an exposition of its theoretical framework, or an essay on a topic of direct relevance to their practice.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Many <a href=\"http://www.rsa.ox.ac.uk/alumni\">alumni from the Ruskin</a> have pursued careers as practising artists, teachers, curators and gallery professionals in both public and private galleries.

These include the study of a wide range of materials of relevance in advanced technological applications, including metals and alloys, composites, semi- and super-conductors, polymers, biomaterials, ceramics and materials for quantum information processing.</p><p>Much of the research is carried out in close collaboration with industry. World-leading research takes place on:</p><ul><li>the characterisation of materials, where there is emphasis on electron microscopy and related techniques</li><li>processing and manufacturing of materials</li><li>modelling of materials, where there is attention to both structures and processes</li><li>properties of materials</li><li>energy materials, including those for batteries, nuclear fusion and photovoltaics</li><li>quantum information processing, which includes groups working on experimental studies, theory and modelling.</li></ul><p>The plasma-facing components and breeding blanket of any future fusion tokamak will be subjected to one of the most extreme engineering environments possible. Materials will experience temperatures of up to 1200C in steady state and 3300C in transient events, and irradiation with 14MeV neutrons, causing displacement damage, transmutation giving rise to compositional changes, and internal H and He generation, plasma facing surfaces also can have  high erosion rates due to interactions with the fusion plasma. Ideally, the materials should not retain tritium or themselves transmute to long-lived radioactive isotopes.

It prepares students for a career in, for example, development, public policy, or policy and programme evaluation. Applicants with a professional background, such as those in evaluation, public health or policy consulting, will enhance their research skills and develop a major piece of research in a world-class environment.</p><p>This course aims to develop your critical analysis, problem solving and research skills in the field of evidence-based interventions and policies for social problems, which will allow you to be both a critical consumer of research and to carry out evaluations and other research designs. Your studies will consider evidence-based practice and policy in relation to, for example, children and families, poverty and inequality, mental health, refugees, drug use, violence and injury prevention, and offending.</p><h3>Course structure</h3><p>The MPhil has six major components:</p><ul><li>core course on evaluation methods</li><li>pathway course, either Social Intervention or Policy Evaluation</li><li>two specialist options, eg on Child and Family Interventions, Social Policies and Health Inequalities, Understanding and Preventing Interpersonal Violence, or Community Analysis and Large-Scale Interventions.

The third term involves largely self-directed study for remaining summative assessments, exam/assessment revision, and further development of the MPhil thesis proposal. Additional lectures and question/answer are typically offered on an optional basis to support students in preparing for exams and/or assessments and using various methodologies for thesis projects. In subsequent terms, MPhil students follow a largely self-directed schedule based on remaining training needs/interests identified with their supervisor, enrol in a second specialist option course, and are encouraged to fully participate in regular seminars, colloquia, and research group meetings offered by the department.</p><h4>MPhil thesis</h4><p>You will write a research thesis to acquire expert knowledge in your area of interest, to apply the research methods, and contribute to new scientific knowledge.</p><h4>Core course in evaluation methods</h4><p>This course, taken over two terms, trains students to critically consume and produce evaluation research for policies and social interventions, focusing on multiple methods, including randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised methods, qualitative evaluation, and systematic reviews. The course has a strong focus on ‘open science’ and research transparency.</p><h4>Pathway course</h4><p> You will select one of two available pathways, to be taken over two terms:</p><ul><li>Social Intervention, covering evidence-based methods to evaluate social interventions, theories underlying interventions, ethical issues, and applying research in practice and policy, including the challenges of implementing programmes in the real world; or</li><li>Policy Evaluation, introducing you to social policy analysis, policy formation, and the relationship between evidence and policy, and to different research methods for evaluating policies, eg quasi- experimental designs, natural experiments.</li></ul><p>You may be able to change your choice of pathway in the first week of the programme.</p><h4>Specialist options</h4><p>You will take two one-term specialist courses from a list of options which may include Children and Families, Social Policies and Health Inequalities, Understanding and Preventing Interpersonal Violence, or Community Analysis and Large-Scale Interventions. The set of options offered each year will vary slightly depending on student interest and staff availability</p><p>MPhil students may attend advanced methods classes, such as Intermediate Statistics, in their second year. </p><h4>Research methods training</h4><p>Students following the social intervention or policy evaluation pathway take a core evaluation methods course. In addition, all student in the MPhil EBSIPE take the following methods courses:</p><ul><li>systematic reviews, quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods, ie to learn to synthesise the best available evidence (two terms)</li><li>quantitative methods, ie key statistical concepts and application in the leading software, R (one term) </li><li>qualitative research methods, ie design, data collection, analysis and qualitative meta-synthesis. </li><li>field methods, ie managing, costing and running real-world evaluations.</li></ul><p>Specialist interdisciplinary training in systematic reviews has led to published masters' theses, for example:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1353/hpu.2022.0056\">2022: ‘The Association of Traumatic Brain Injury with Neurologic and Psychiatric Illnesses among Individuals Experiencing Homelessness: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis’ </a></li><li><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/injuryprev-2019-043619\">2020: ‘Evaluating the impact of penalising the use of mobile phones while driving on road traffic fatalities, serious injuries and mobile phone use: a systematic review’</a></li><li><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.12690\">2018: ‘A cumulative meta-analysis of the effects of individual physical activity interventions targeting healthy adults’ </a></li><li><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10567-017-0232-7\">2017: ‘Parenting Programs for the Prevention of Child Physical Abuse Recurrence: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis’</a></li><li><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010544.pub2\">2014: ‘Centre‐based day care for children younger than five years of age in high‐income countries’</a></li><li><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0065442\">2013: ‘Reporting Quality of Social and Psychological Intervention Trials: A Systematic Review of Reporting Guidelines and Trial Publications’</a></li><li><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11121-012-0314-1\">2013: ‘Improving Positive Parenting Skills and Reducing Harsh and Abusive Parenting in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review’</a></li></ul><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Department of Social Policy and Intervention and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Students are able to meet their potential supervisor in the first week of term. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Department of Social Policy and Intervention.</p><p>In the case of students who require specific help to adjust to an academic programme or to a new range of skills, the supervisor will work with them to ensure that they have additional support.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>Assessment will be based on your MPhil thesis. The thesis is undertaken throughout the duration of the course. You will also be assessed by a series of assessments throughout the year using a combination of examinations and/or submitted coursework assignments (summative assessments). </p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Recent graduates from the MPhil have gone on to study for doctorates in a range of high quality universities.

This involves the submission of a piece of written work that is examined by two assessors, neither of whom will be your supervisors. This process is to ensure that your work is of potential DPhil quality and that the methodology of the research is appropriate and feasible. Upon successful completion of the Transfer of Status, you would usually undertake a period of primary fieldwork/data collection over one to two years.</p><p>You will also be required to apply for a Confirmation of Status as DPhil sometime between the 12th and 18th term after admission. This will also involve the submission of a piece of written work that is assessed by two assessors, neither of whom will be your supervisors. The Confirmation of Status assessment is different to the Transfer of Status assessment as the assessors will be focusing on how the research is progressing, the quality of the draft chapters/papers, and on the plan for completion. The assessors will be looking to ensure that you are making the appropriate amount of progress in the development of your thesis, so that thesis submission will be achieved within the time limit.</p><p>You will be expected to submit a substantive academic thesis of around 50,000 words after six or, at most, eight years from the date of admission. To be successfully awarded a DPhil in Evidence Based Health Care you will need to defend your thesis orally (viva voce) in front of two appointed examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Most students commencing this programme are already in employment and continue their professional work alongside their doctoral research.

You will carry out your research project in one of eight departments after an initial training period. The three streams of the NERC-Oxford DTP are as follows:</p><h3 class=\"more-less\">Biodiversity, ecology and evolutionary processes</h3><div class=\"more-less\"><p>Research in this theme in Oxford spans pure to applied science, linked by an overarching aim to understand the generation, maintenance and loss of biological diversity from the gene to the species, and the structure, function and dynamics of ecosystems at a variety of spatial and temporal scales.</p><p>Pure aspects of research include unravelling biotic and abiotic interactions between the atmosphere and biosphere, and their role in the Earth System; the effect of the environment on evolutionary processes at all levels from genes and genomes to populations; the use of experimental, macroecological and phylogenetic approaches to understand the biology and distribution of species; the quantification of evolutionary patterns and the assembly of modern biodiversity by integrating fossil and genetic datasets; and understanding carbon and other biogeochemical cycles.</p><p>Information generated by research in these areas provides the critical foundation to address many of the global challenges facing humanity today from climate change and biodiversity loss, to food security, to pest and pathogen outbreaks. </p></div><h3 class=\"more-less\">Physical climate system</h3><div class=\"more-less\"><p>Oxford researchers are advancing the understanding of the climate system behaviour across the full breadth of atmosphere, oceans, cryosphere and biosphere. This includes atmospheric dynamics from weather to seasonal prediction to climate; atmospheric composition, clouds and aerosols; the physics and biogeochemical coupling of the oceans; and studies of past climates and the effects of biosphere change on climate.</p><p>Oxford has new strengths in cryosphere and Arctic research and our researchers are established in such areas as the effects of anthropogenic climate change on the physical climate system and biogeochemical processes, while also leading the way in innovative citizen science, from climateprediction.net which uses a distributed network of volunteer computers to provide very large ensembles of climate model simulations, to rapid disaster response.</p></div><h3 class=\"more-less\">Dynamic Earth, surface processes and natural hazards</h3><div class=\"more-less\"><p>Within this stream investigators are developing new analytical, theoretical and experimental approaches to image, simulate and understand Earth’s internal structure; and advancing understanding of the fundamental processes that underpin the behaviour of earthquakes, volcanoes and their impacts on timescales from the human, to the geological.</p><p>The DTP is developing new approaches in the field of climate adaptation, the management of climate-related risks to infrastructure, and redefining relationships between Earth surface processes and climate in desert and wider dryland regions. Oxford researchers continue to develop and apply new ways to investigate deep Earth and Earth-surface processes from the formation of the Earth to human history through experiment, analysis and theory.  </p></div><p>During the first two terms, you will have access to a training programme during which you will have the opportunity to develop your research skills and acquire an understanding of how researchers in other disciplines operate, while also writing your own research proposal in collaboration with your supervisor(s) and in many cases an external partner. You will be recruited to a research stream, and in some cases to a pre-determined project (eg with an industrial CASE partner). You will begin your course based with the DTP.</p><p>You will be offered training in 'hard' skills such as scientific computing, statistics and numerical modelling, as well as being offered a broad-brush understanding of the Earth system across all disciplines of the DTP. There will also be course modules in softer transferable skills such as project design, proposal writing, communication and problem solving to underpin the exploration of research methodologies.</p><p>Elective training will continue throughout the degree and you will be able to select from a portfolio of advanced training courses to create your own tailored training programme. Later in the course, modules will include thesis writing and paper writing. You will remain a member of the DTP even after transferring out to a department in term three.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Doctoral Training Partnership and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Doctoral Training Partnership. The DTP requires students to have at least two supervisors to ensure a good level of support both pastorally and academically.</p><p>For some projects it may be beneficial to seek supervision across two or more departments to support different aspects of the project.</p><p>Departments have differing guidelines on how often students meet with their supervisors (this will probably vary through the project, and may also depend on the area of research), and we recommend that students establish a routine at an early stage in their project development.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>Your work will be informally assessed on the training modules throughout your degree and you will need to attain a certain number of attendance and submission credits before you begin your research project, and each year thereafter.</p><p>You will carry out your DPhil project in one of our departments and will gain your DPhil from the department in which you carry out your research project. You will follow the same milestones and assessments as a standard DPhil, so you will have Probationer Research Student (PRS) status until you confirm your status as a DPhil student by term six. By term nine you will confirm status and you will submit your thesis for assessment by the end of term 12. The eight departments of the DTP are as follows:</p><ul><li>Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art</li><li>Department of Physics (sub-department of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics)</li><li>Department of Earth Sciences</li><li>School of Geography and the Environment</li><li>Department of Biology</li><li>Mathematical Institute</li><li>Department of Chemistry</li><li>Department of Engineering Science.</li></ul><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>You should be equipped with a wide range of skills that you will need whether you wish to pursue a career in research, government or the private sector.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

The classes on American literature, contexts and approaches introduce representative key texts and current debates on the literature and cultural history of Colonial America and the US. This course is designed to provide a solid foundation for advanced literary study in American literature and culture.</p><h4>B. Core course: Bibliography, theories of text, history of the book, manuscript studies</h4><p>This is a compulsory, assessed course, taught via a range of lectures and seminars in each of the first two terms. It is designed to train you for research in English, through the study of bibliography, palaeography, book history and theories of text in the Colonial American and US national contexts.</p><h4>C. Special options</h4><p>The special option courses present an excellent opportunity for you to develop and pursue your research interests, whether related or unrelated to other work undertaken as part of the MSt degree. You are not constrained to follow option courses in American literature and, indeed, option courses often traverse the boundaries of the broad periods and subject groups. The courses are taught in weekly, small group seminars.</p><h4>D. Dissertation</h4><p>You will write a dissertation on a subject of your choice, but related to the work you have been doing over the year in the English and American Studies strand of the MSt program.

We also offer unrivalled training in the core skills for research in medieval studies. This includes reading, understanding and editing medieval manuscripts and early printed books; developing skills in languages such as Old English and Old Norse; and debating a wide range of approaches and methods in the study of medieval literature and culture. Optional courses with leading scholars help to focus students’ interests, and a dissertation provides the chance to pursue in-depth research to a high quality.</p><p>The range of the literature and approaches likely to be encountered is challenging and rewarding. We have no one method or theoretical approach; the course gives you time to learn which sort of medieval studies you wish to practise, or invent. Whatever your past experience and expected career path, the course can help you to become an accomplished medievalist with a wide range of expertise.</p><h3>Course structure</h3><p>The MSt programme consists of four main components as outlined below. </p><h4>A. Core course: Literature, contexts and approaches</h4><p>This core course is not formally assessed. Seminars over the first two terms introduce a range of medieval literatures composed between 650 and 1550, and a variety of topics and approaches for consideration, such as voice and writing, authorship, form and formalism, and historicism. Students give presentations in the weekly seminars.</p><h4>B. Core course: Bibliography, theories of text, history of the book, manuscript studies</h4><p>This core course provides extensive training in handling and thinking about the ‘material text’ – how we read, date, interpret, and edit from primary sources – including coursework studying some of Oxford’s astounding holdings of manuscripts and early printed books. Such training will transform the way you think about medieval literature, bringing it to archaeological life, and open up new resources for research as well as new kinds of research.</p><p>Seminars over the first two terms introduce skills in transcription, palaeography, codicology and editing, and reflection on the significance of studying the material forms and textual transmission of medieval literature. </p><h4>C. Special options</h4><p>Students take two special option courses, one in the first term and one in the second term, choosing from a range of about six which change each year. Recent years’ courses have included Anglo-Saxon riddles, Cynewulf, archetypes of the high Middle Ages, early Middle English women’s religious writing, post-Conquest literature, Chaucer’s places, intellectual dissidence and dissent in the fifteenth century, the language of Middle English literature, and the languages and literatures of medieval Wales and Ireland. Students are also welcome to choose a course offered by another MSt strand, for example in another period, or in the English Language.</p><p>Option courses are taught in weekly small-group seminars. </p><h4>D. Dissertation</h4><p>In discussion with faculty members, each student devises a research project of their own on any subject concerning the language, literature, or cultural history of the British Isles and the Norse world in the Middle Ages. They receive one-to-one supervision on that research and complete a dissertation of 10,000-11,000 words by the end of the third term (June). These dissertations bring to bear the skills and perspectives acquired throughout the course on one focused piece of research.</p><p><strong>The MPhil</strong></p><p>For those who would like to take their studies further, the <a href=\"//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/mphil-english-studies-medieval-period\">MPhil</a> runs over two years, with the same first-year syllabus as that of the MSt course. It includes further taught courses, opportunities for more linguistic training, and a second, longer dissertation in the second year. It is possible to apply for this course from the outset or apply to switch onto it at the end of the MSt.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Faculty of English and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Faculty of English.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>In addition to the dissertation, students sit a short transcription test and submit a piece of coursework. relating to the ‘B’ core course as well as two further essays relating to the two special options courses taken.</p><p>Students normally take all four components to fulfil the requirements of the degree. All course work will be completed by the end of the second term (Hilary term), leaving the summer term (Trinity term) for the writing of the dissertation, which is submitted in early June.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Many English taught-course students go onto doctoral research, both at Oxford and at other universities worldwide.

Areas of special strength include the history and practice of cultural criticism, literature and science, English and world literature, transatlantic cultural exchange, theatre and drama, life writing, material culture, comic and nonsense literature, aestheticism and decadence, poetry and poetics. Individual profiles are available on the <a href=\"https://www.english.ox.ac.uk/victorian-period\">English Faculty website</a>. </p><h3>Course structure</h3><p>The MSt programme comprises four main components spread over three academic terms, through which you have the opportunity to pursue interests within your chosen MSt strand, as well as across period boundaries. In the first two terms, you will take a core course (A), a compulsory course in book history and theories of text (B), and choose two courses from a wide range of options (C). Under the guidance of a specialist supervisor you will also research and write a dissertation (D), which is submitted at the end of the third term.</p><h4>A. Core course: Literature, Contexts and Approaches</h4><p>The core course for this MSt is formally non-assessed but compulsory. It aims to further students’ knowledge of the literature in the period 1830-1914, and to deepen their sense of established and emerging critical debates in the field. The course ranges across genres and modes, engaging with theatrical works, poetry, and prose writing, and classes draw on both primary and secondary texts. Each class involves student presentations (on which feedback is provided).</p><p>Topics for discussion vary each year, but the following list gives an indication of various topics that have been studied in recent years: ‘Competing Forms of Victorian Studies’, ‘National, Transnational and Global Literatures’, ‘Culture and its Critics’, ‘Slave Narratives and Diasporic Modernity’, ‘Performance and Melodrama’, ‘Gender and Sexualities’, ‘Aesthetics and Material Culture’. The central aim of this course is to provide a solid foundation for advanced literary study in the period.</p><h4>B. Core course: Bibliography, Theories of Text, History of the Book, Manuscript Studies</h4><p>This is a compulsory, assessed course, taught via a range of lectures and seminars in each of the first two terms. It provides an introduction to bibliography, book history and textual scholarship as they apply to the study of literature. This course is designed to enable you to:</p><ul><li>use and appraise a range of approaches to studying the material form of books;</li><li>understand the process of making books in the machine-press era (1800–1950);</li><li>explore describe the physical features of printed books;</li><li>analyse how the meaning of a text is shaped by its medium (print or manuscript);</li><li>understand the roles of authors, printers, and publishers in the production and distribution of books; and</li><li>apply and evaluate textual critical approaches to dealing with the problems of material texts.</li></ul><p>Topics for discussion vary each year, but the following list gives an indication of various topics that have been studied in recent years: ‘Book History and Literary Study’; ‘Manuscript, Print, and Meaning’; ‘Making Books’; ‘Authors, Publishers, and Copyright’; ‘Textual Criticism and Theories of Reading’; and ‘Investigating Illustration’; ‘Serialisation’; and ‘Celebrity’.</p><h4>C. Special options</h4><p>The special option courses present an excellent opportunity for you to develop and pursue your research interests, whether related or unrelated to other work undertaken as part of the MSt degree. You are not constrained to follow option courses within the designated period, and indeed, option courses often traverse the boundaries of the broad periods. The courses are taught in weekly, small group seminars. Students read a range of primary and secondary texts in advance and engage in discussion during the seminars, often led each week by one or two student presentations. These are not assessed formally but students are given verbal and written feedback on them.</p><p>Examples of past ‘C-course options include: ‘Pluralism and the Imagination: from Romanticism to Modernism’; ‘Literary London, 1820-1920’; ‘Senses of humour: Wordsworth to Ashbery’; ‘Literatures of Empire and Nation 1880-1935’; ‘American Renaissances’; ‘Henry James and his Literary Legacies’; ‘On Being (and Not Being) a Person: The Function of Literary Character’. Options change from year to year, depending on the availability of faculty members and on their current teaching and research interests.</p><h4>D. Dissertation</h4><p>You will write a dissertation on a subject of your choice but related to the work you have been doing over the year. In the first term of the MSt you will be assigned to a member of academic staff who will act as your supervisor. Students will have the opportunity to present their dissertation ideas at a one-day conference that they organise in conjunction with the faculty office, usually at the start of Trinity term. Each student on the course gives a 10-minute presentation on their work in progress, with the opportunity to receive feedback from their peers and the course convenors.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Faculty of English and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Faculty of English.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>The programme is assessed via the submission of four pieces of coursework. In addition to the dissertation, you will submit three essays – one at the end of the first term, and two at the end of the second term – relating to the ‘B’ and ‘C’ courses that have been taken. All course work will be completed by the end of the second term (Hilary term), leaving the summer term (Trinity term) to complete the dissertation, which is submitted in June. The outcomes of the MSt examination are pass, fail, merit, or distinction. Candidates must achieve a pass mark on each element of the examination to be awarded the MSt.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Many English taught-course students go onto doctoral research, both at Oxford and at other universities worldwide.

Its varied components allow students to study texts in careful detail, and to pursue large and ambitious concepts: as such, the MSt is well-suited both to those who want an additional, stand-alone year of coherent literary study, and those who are interested in going on to undertake doctoral research. The mixture of interpretative, scholarly, and writerly skills that the course helps to foster are ideal for applicants interested in a range of subsequent paths, both inside and outside the academy.</p><h3>Course structure</h3><p>The MSt programme consists of four main components. In the first two terms, you will take a core course (A), in which specialists in Early Modern literature from across the English Faculty will introduce you to key concepts and debates within the period 1550-1700. You will also take a second core course (B), in book history and the materiality of the text, which will allow you to engage closely with the unparalleled collections of the Bodleian Libraries. You will additionally choose two courses from a wide range of thematic options (C courses), which might focus on a given author in depth, or explore a broader theme. Finally, under the guidance of a specialist supervisor you will also research and write a dissertation on a topic of your choosing, which is submitted in the final term. </p><h4>A. Core course: Critical Questions in Early Modern Literature</h4><p>This is the core course for this MSt, and introduces students to key texts and current debates on the literature and cultural history of the period. It is intended both to help students find their feet as they begin advanced literary study, and to allow them to sample discussions taking place at the cutting edge of the field. It is formally non-assessed but compulsory.</p><p>Each seminar of this course is led by a different scholar with expertise in the area being discussed, ensuring your exposure to a wide range of texts and approaches. Recent sessions include: ‘Meddling with Allegory’, ‘Travel, Race, Power’, and ‘The Female Signature’.</p><h4>B. Core course: Bibliography, Theories of Text, History of the Book, Manuscript Studies</h4><p>On this course you will explore the materiality of texts: drawing on the unparalleled early modern holdings of the Bodleian Library, you will consider the production, circulation and reception of texts as physical objects. This means examining, among other things, the ways in which manuscripts moved between scribes and readers; annotated books and the history of reading; palaeography; editing and ideology; and the roles of publishers and printers in the period. Seminars will offer a blend of critical reflection alongside first-hand access to rare print and manuscript materials. </p><p>Alongside its rich holdings of printed books, the <a href=\"http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/\">Bodleian Library</a> contains large collections of manuscript prose and poetry which have yet to be fully charted, as well as many hybrid books that combine both print and manuscript in diverse ways. Its resources include collections in Latin, Greek and Hebrew, as well as autograph manuscripts by John Donne, John Milton and Elizabeth I. The <a href=\"https://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/csb\">Centre for the Study of the Book</a> also offers MSt students a hands-on understanding of the material, intellectual and social history of Early Modern print and manuscript culture, while the Bibliography Room offers students the chance to learn how to set type and to print by hand.</p><p>Recent student work has included an edition of early modern letters (never before edited); an account of post-Reformation collecting and library-building; and a study of recently discovered women’s manuscripts. The course is taught via seminars and tutorials in each of the first two terms. It forms an integral part of the skills with which the MSt equips its students, and it is compulsory and assessed.</p><h4>C. Special options</h4><p>The special option courses present an excellent opportunity for you to develop and pursue your research interests. Each year the special options that are offered reflect the diversity of interest and approach within the English Faculty itself, and will encompass various methodologies and degrees of focus. Recent and future options include: ‘Slow Reading Spenser’, ‘Early Modern Life Writing’, ‘Of Essays: Origins and Afterlives’ and ‘Twelfth Night’.</p><p>You are not constrained to follow option courses within the designated period and, indeed, option courses often traverse the boundaries of the broad periods. The courses are taught in weekly, small group seminars.</p><h4>D. Dissertation</h4><p>You will write a 10,000- to 11,000-word dissertation on a subject of your choice, but related to the work you have been doing over the year. You will be assigned to a member of academic staff who will act as your supervisor, and will have the opportunity to work closely with them over an extended period of time while developing your work.  Like all of the teaching for the MSt, the dissertation supervision is intended to help students develop both their skills as researchers, and their fluency as writers.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Faculty of English and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff.

A typical term will involve a great deal of independent research, punctuated by meetings with the supervisor who will be able to suggest direction and address concerns throughout the writing process. </p><p>In addition you will have the opportunity to attend a wide range of classes, seminars and lectures in order to learn bibliographic and research skills, interact with other researchers or gain new perspectives on your work. You may also be encouraged to attend the research skills courses available as part of the master's (MSt) programme, depending how much of this training has been covered previously.</p><p>The English Faculty is not responsible for providing teaching opportunities for research students as most undergraduate teaching in Oxford is organised by individual colleges. Teaching is not a compulsory part of the DPhil. But research students may wish to gain some teaching experience, so long as it does not interfere with their own progress. Those research students who wish to gain teaching experience are invited to attend Faculty-run preparatory teaching workshops and seminars, as well as enrolling on a Teaching Mentor Scheme. </p><h3>Further information about studying part-time</h3><p>The faculty's research degrees are not available by distance learning. Although there will be no requirement to reside in Oxford, part-time research students must attend the University on a regular basis (particularly in term-time: October and November, mid-January to mid-March, and late April to mid-June) for supervision, study, research seminars and skills training.</p><p>The faculty appreciates that part-time research students will have non-standard attendance and work patterns. To ensure a comprehensive integration into the faculty's and University's research culture and with their full-time peer groups, a pattern of attendance at training events and research seminars would form part of the general study agreement for part-time students, alongside the individualised arrangements between supervisor and student. You cannot be enrolled in the part-time course if you need a visa to study in the UK.</p><p>As a part-time student you will be required to attend seminars, supervision meetings and other obligations in Oxford for a minimum of 30 days each year. Part-time students are expected to be present in Oxford for Faculty induction, college induction, and an initial meeting with supervisors in order to decide upon the programme of study for that term and to develop a plan for the coming year’s work. These are usually all held in 0th week of Michaelmas term of the 1st year. There will be some flexibility in the dates of term-time attendance which will be determined by mutual agreement with your supervisor, but part-time students are expected to be in Oxford in order to participate in key Faculty activities, which will occupy on average 20 days per term.Attendance outside of term-time is determined by mutual agreement with your supervisor.</p><p><br/>Part-time students are expected to spend some periods in Oxford in at least two terms per year in the first two years.Part-time students are expected to attend at least half of the Faculty's (usually weekly or fortnightly) research seminar meetings in their subject area and to contribute to them as much as full-time students do over the length of their course.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Faculty of English and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Faculty of English.</p><p>It is expected that you will have at least two substantial supervisions in each term (or for part-time students, at least one each term). In the case of students who require specific help to adjust to an academic programme or to a new range of skills, the supervisor will work with them to ensure that they have additional support.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>You will be enrolled initially as a Probationary Research Student and will then apply to transfer to full DPhil status during your first year (or for part-time students, by the end of your second year). A further assessment of your work and progress takes place during the third year of the programme (for part-time students, this would be completed by the first term of your sixth year).</p><p>In the final year of your course, you will need to submit a thesis of 80,000 to 100,000 words for assessment by an internal examiner, from within the University, and an external examiner, from beyond. There will then be a ‘viva voce’ oral examination with the two examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Graduates from the English Faculty are employed across a wide range of sectors. Many take up academic positions in the UK and overseas. Other graduates pursue careers in occupations including teaching, the arts, heritage, librarianship, journalism, publishing, law and the civil service.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

While the MPhil functions as a course in its own right, it is also designed to take students to the stage where they can embark on doctoral research in Egyptology.", "about": "<div class=\"field-item even\"><div id=\"content-tab\"><p>The MPhil in Egyptology normally has two paths through the curriculum. The first, Syllabus A, allows those with previous training in Egyptology to pursue their study of the subject to a higher level, to gain specialised expertise, and to begin advanced research in an area of their choice. The second, Syllabus B, enables graduates in another discipline to convert to Egyptology through a graduate level course that offers a certain amount of specialisation, including a significant element of advanced research. In both cases, syllabuses are tailored to the interests of individual students. </p><p>The study of ancient Egyptian language and textual culture lies at the heart of the degree and is generally a major component of Syllabus A. The principal focus throughout both syllabuses is on detailed familiarity with the primary sources, studied in the original language and through the original manuscripts where possible, and with various methods and approaches. Use of a range of interpretive and analytical approaches to the primary sources is integral to the course, including, for example, historiographical and/or literary-critical frameworks; overall there is an emphasis on texts as artefacts in a material context.</p><p>The syllabuses can also be designed with an archaeological and/or material-culture focus. You will have the opportunity to develop your skills in working with Egyptian artefacts from the extensive and diverse collections of the Ashmolean Museum. </p><p>The MPhil is a very intensive course. For example, you must treat the university vacations as integral parts of your work time and you will be expected to take relatively limited holidays. From the start of your course you should also think about whether you need to do fieldwork in Egypt or elsewhere and when this will best be done. Where possible, if you have not been to Egypt before you should ideally try to visit before the end of the course, to experience something of the landscape and country.</p><p>The number of students accepted for the course each year is very small. This ensures that teaching can be tailored to the research interests and training requirements of individual students. Teaching is also very much focused around small groups and one-on-one tutorials and supervisions for which small cohorts are vital. In the first year you will share language classes and lectures on history and culture with first year undergraduates. Some other classes may also be shared with undergraduates and graduates on other degrees where appropriate for your research training needs.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies. Students can expect to meet with their supervisor 2-3 times per term in the first year and in the second year, every second week of term, with further meetings outside term as needed and if possible.</p><h3>Assessment </h3><p>Students on Syllabus A are normally required to sit one or two qualifying examinations in the language(s) and/or language phase(s) they are specialising in, during or after the end of Trinity term of their first year. Students on Syllabus B will sit two qualifying examinations in Middle Egyptian during or after the end of Trinity term of their first year.</p><p>During the second year, you will write a dissertation. This will give you the opportunity to identify and design your own research project and to develop advanced research skills. You should expect to spend the Easter vacation finishing your dissertation, which must be submitted half way through Trinity term.</p><p>Two research essays developed out of work done for one part of the course must be submitted by the end of Hilary term of the second year. Depending on the course design, there can also be a take-home examination at the start of Trinity term of the second year.</p><p>The final examinations are sat towards the end of Trinity term. Different examination provision may be made for students who have chosen options that are offered in other faculties, such as Classics or Archaeology.</p><p>Further information on the course, and the examination process, can be found in the course handbook via the course webpage on the faculty's website.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Asian and Middle Eastern studies graduates have found employment in many diverse fields including business, finance law, civil service, journalism, government and industry.</p><p>Many graduates have also undertaken further research into subjects linked with Asian and Middle Eastern studies and have pursued successful careers in the academic world, education and in museums.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

You will participate in classes on research design, and on the quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis techniques used to yield research findings. Supervision sessions will support you in identifying research questions towards dissertation research, selecting areas for literature review, carrying out field work, and reviewing drafts of the dissertation. Supported ICT sessions on literature access skills (including electronic searches) will be provided by the department's library staff.</p><p>All students on this course may take part in an optional ‘internship’ in which they work with an academic/research team on an ongoing research project for a short period. During this time, they gain experience by working on the variety of activities that constitute an everyday part of doing educational research.</p><p>The MSc programme is offered on both a full time (one year) and part time (two year) basis (note: prospective students must apply specifically to either the full time course or the part time course). The degree and expectations for both modes of study are equally rigorous: part time students attend classes with full time students, but these are spread over two years to balance with work and personal circumstances. Part time students attend classes one day per week during term time and are encouraged to spend at least one further day a week working in Oxford libraries and participating in relevant research seminars and research events or taking non-assessed courses.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Department of Education. This will be done on the basis of the topic of research and the availability of individual supervisors. It is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Department of Education. Students may expect 10 hours of contact time with their supervisors over the course of one academic year. The specific timing and number of meetings may vary somewhat according to the nature and requirements of a student’s dissertation project.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>Students will complete six modules. Each module includes formative coursework (typically an essay) part-way through the term, and a summative submitted assignment at the end of the module, with marks for each module based entirely on the summative assignment. Students will also complete a dissertation on a topic selected by the student and approved by the supervisor. There are no formal milestones for the dissertation except final submission in August, but each student’s supervisor will monitor progress and advise on appropriate timelines/checkpoints based on the nature and requirements of the student’s individual project.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>The most recent Oxford University Destination of Leavers from Higher Education Survey made contact with 182 MSc Education students who graduated from the Department of Education between 2012 and 2017.

A typical term will involve a great deal of independent research, punctuated by meetings with the supervisor who will be able to suggest direction and address concerns throughout the writing process. </p><p>In addition you will have the opportunity to attend a wide range of classes, seminars and lectures in order to learn bibliographic and research skills, interact with other researchers or gain new perspectives on your work. You may also be encouraged to attend the research skills courses available as part of the master's (MSt) programme, depending how much of this training has been covered previously.</p><p>The English Faculty is not responsible for providing teaching opportunities for research students as most undergraduate teaching in Oxford is organised by individual colleges. Teaching is not a compulsory part of the DPhil. But research students may wish to gain some teaching experience, so long as it does not interfere with their own progress. Those research students who wish to gain teaching experience are invited to attend Faculty-run preparatory teaching workshops and seminars, as well as enrolling on a Teaching Mentor Scheme. </p><h3>Further information about studying part-time</h3><p>The faculty's research degrees are not available by distance learning. Although there will be no requirement to reside in Oxford, part-time research students must attend the University on a regular basis (particularly in term-time: October and November, mid-January to mid-March, and late April to mid-June) for supervision, study, research seminars and skills training.</p><p>The faculty appreciates that part-time research students will have non-standard attendance and work patterns. To ensure a comprehensive integration into the faculty's and University's research culture and with their full-time peer groups, a pattern of attendance at training events and research seminars would form part of the general study agreement for part-time students, alongside the individualised arrangements between supervisor and student. You cannot be enrolled in the part-time course if you need a visa to study in the UK.</p><p>As a part-time student you will be required to attend seminars, supervision meetings and other obligations in Oxford for a minimum of 30 days each year. Part-time students are expected to be present in Oxford for Faculty induction, college induction, and an initial meeting with supervisors in order to decide upon the programme of study for that term and to develop a plan for the coming year’s work. These are usually all held in 0th week of Michaelmas term of the 1st year. There will be some flexibility in the dates of term-time attendance which will be determined by mutual agreement with your supervisor, but part-time students are expected to be in Oxford in order to participate in key Faculty activities, which will occupy on average 20 days per term.Attendance outside of term-time is determined by mutual agreement with your supervisor.</p><p><br/>Part-time students are expected to spend some periods in Oxford in at least two terms per year in the first two years.Part-time students are expected to attend at least half of the Faculty's (usually weekly or fortnightly) research seminar meetings in their subject area and to contribute to them as much as full-time students do over the length of their course.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Faculty of English and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Faculty of English.</p><p>It is expected that you will have at least two substantial supervisions in each term (or for part-time students, at least one each term). In the case of students who require specific help to adjust to an academic programme or to a new range of skills, the supervisor will work with them to ensure that they have additional support.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>You will be enrolled initially as a Probationary Research Student and will then apply to transfer to full DPhil status during your first year (or for part-time students, by the end of your second year). A further assessment of your work and progress takes place during the third year of the programme (for part-time students, this would be completed by the first term of your sixth year).</p><p>In the final year of your course, you will need to submit a thesis of 80,000 to 100,000 words for assessment by an internal examiner, from within the University, and an external examiner, from beyond. There will then be a ‘viva voce’ oral examination with the two examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Graduates from the English Faculty are employed across a wide range of sectors. Many take up academic positions in the UK and overseas. Other graduates pursue careers in occupations including teaching, the arts, heritage, librarianship, journalism, publishing, law and the civil service.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

You will choose a topic for your master's project in discussions with your supervisor. Together, the course will provide opportunities for you to deepen your understanding of child development theories and their relevance to decisions about children’s education and well-being.</p><p>The course is structured with two papers that focus on the disciplinary underpinnings to child development and education (Foundation Learning and Wellbeing and Cognitive Development and Educational Attainment). Two further papers in the first term aim to develop students’ research skills (Foundations of Educational Research 1: Concepts and Design and Introduction to Quantitative Research). In the second term, students take a required module (Cognitive Development and Educational Attainment) and select two other options from a selection of disciplinary-focused modules that will be confirmed at the beginning of the course (some examples include Core Principles of Child Assessment, The Implementation of the Rights of Children, Critical Digital Innovation, Education, the Internet &amp; Society, Global Higher Education, Perspectives and Debates in Qualitative Research, Intermediate Quantitative Research, Researching with the South: Decolonizing communication practices in education research). Some students may choose to audit additional electives, but these are not formally assessed. In addition, you will complete either field work or conduct secondary data analysis for your master's dissertation. You will choose your master’s project in discussions with your supervisor.</p><p>Throughout the course, you will participate in lectures, seminars, and workshops.

For the transfer process you need to write a report and give a presentation on your research to date and your plans for progressing. Your work is assessed by two faculty members or researchers in the department who are not your supervisors and involves an oral exam. At the beginning of your third year of study (beginning of fifth year for a part-time student) your progress towards completion is again formally assessed, by a Confirmation of DPhil Status process. A report of your progress and your plan for completion is submitted and is assessed by two faculty or researchers in the department who are not your supervisors and involves an oral exam.</p><p>At the end of your research you will be required to submit a substantial thesis which is read and examined by experts in the field, one from the department and one from elsewhere. You will then defend this thesis at a Viva Voce examination with the two examiners. It is anticipated that the thesis will result in the publication of two or three journal papers.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Doctoral graduates from Engineering Science are ideally equipped for careers in a wide range of engineering, which is often in their specialisms but in many cases is not.  Most enjoy engineering-related careers including: engineering companies, consulting companies, start-up companies (sometimes based on the students research), research and development companies and academia.  Others enter the broad range of professions where their high degree of ability in mathematical and systems modelling is required, such as finance and patent law.

Multiple stressors, such as climatic extremes and chemical pollution, are driving many of these declines. Wetlands and fringing ecosystems are exceptionally biodiverse, critical for combating the climate emergency and essential for enhancing community resilience to extreme weather events such as storms and floods. These ecosystems are among the most threatened globally, impacted by multiple environmental stressors. However, our understanding of these impacts is limited, thereby hindering conservation and restoration efforts, and impeding their potential as nature-based and bioengineered solutions.</p><p>The EcoWild NERC Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) programme has been designed to deliver the next generation of innovative researchers and conservationists needed to protect some of the Earth’s most vulnerable and valuable ecosystems.</p><p>EcoWild is a unique partnership, led by Heriot-Watt University, that brings together research expertise and innovation across various fields including environmental toxicology, ecology, multiple stressor theory and modelling, wetland conservation and restoration, socioeconomics, community engagement, management and governance; and involves some of the leading UK experts in these fields. Full research themes and details of the partnership can be found on the EcoWild website (For links see <em>Further information and enquiries</em>). </p><p>The course is available in both full- and part-time study modes. If you are studying full-time, you will spend four years (or eight years if studying part-time) at Oxford working on your DPhil project with your main supervisor. For full-time students, NERC funding will cover three years and eight-months and a comparable proportion of the duration of part-time study. You will have a co-supervisor from one of the other academic partners (Heriot-Watt University, University of York, University of the Highlands and Islands, Centre for Ecology and Hydrology) and a co-supervisor from a non-academic partner (such as Natural England, the Freshwater Biological Association, Scottish Government Marine and Fisheries). Each year you will also receive world class taught training in multi-stressor science and wetland ecology in a mix of in-person cohort-building events and online training. The training is enriched through the active involvement of our associated partners, who contribute to the design and delivery of the programme, organise challenge events, and offer secondments and internships. This provides students with valuable real world experience in addressing environmental problems and working in a professional environment. In addition to specialised training, EcoWild students will attend careers events and established workshops, including for data management, time management, leadership, writing skills and viva preparation, aligning with the Vitae Research Development Framework.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Department of Biology and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Department of Biology.</p><p>Students will meet with the supervisor at least twice a month.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>All students will be initially admitted to the status of Probationer Research Student (PRS). Within a maximum of six terms as a PRS student if studying full-time (around 12 terms if studying part-time), you will be expected to apply for transfer of status from Probationer Research Student to DPhil status. This application is normally made by the fourth term. (likely to be by the eight term for part-time students).</p><p>A successful transfer of status from PRS to DPhil status will require a report that will consist of an introductory part that could become the introduction to the thesis, one rather well-worked analysis of preliminary data representing roughly the equivalent of one thesis chapter, and a plan for the other chapters in the thesis including a detailed timetable. Students who are successful at transfer will also be expected to apply for and gain confirmation of DPhil status to show that your work continues to be on track. This will need to done within nine terms of admission if studying full-time (around 18 terms if studying part-time).</p><p>Both milestones normally involve an interview with two assessors (other than your supervisor) and therefore provide important experience for the final oral examination.</p><p>Full-time students will be expected to submit a substantial thesis of up to 50,000 words after four years from the date of admission (after eight years for part-time students).</p><p>To be successfully awarded a DPhil in Biology you will need to defend your thesis orally (viva voce) in front of two appointed examiners.   </p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>DPhil graduates in biological sciences at Oxford continue to a wide range of careers after graduating.

Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Medical Sciences Division.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>In the first year, each of the MSc projects are written up as dissertations. The course concludes the following September with an oral examination.</p><p>In the second year, you are initially accepted as Probationary Research Students (PRS) and transfer to full DPhil status by the end of the fourth term. This involves the preparation of a transfer report and an interview to discuss the research you have carried out so far and your future plans with two independent scientists who have relevant expertise.</p><p>During the final years of the course you will write a thesis which you will need to defend orally (<em>viva voce</em>).</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>This course has been running since 1996 and more than 100 students have now successfully graduated. It was previously known as the Doctoral Training Programme in Neuroscience (1+3).</p><p>Over 75% of the programme's graduates remained in academia as post-doctoral research scientists, either securing prestigious personal fellowships or positions on a grant, and most of the others secured positions in science communication, science administration or went into medicine. Only 5% opted to leave science altogether.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

Multiple stressors, such as climatic extremes and chemical pollution, are driving many of these declines. Wetlands and fringing ecosystems are exceptionally biodiverse, critical for combating the climate emergency and essential for enhancing community resilience to extreme weather events such as storms and floods. These ecosystems are among the most threatened globally, impacted by multiple environmental stressors. However, our understanding of these impacts is limited, thereby hindering conservation and restoration efforts, and impeding their potential as nature-based and bioengineered solutions.</p><p>The EcoWild NERC Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) programme has been designed to deliver the next generation of innovative researchers and conservationists needed to protect some of the Earth’s most vulnerable and valuable ecosystems.</p><p>EcoWild is a unique partnership, led by Heriot-Watt University, that brings together research expertise and innovation across various fields including environmental toxicology, ecology, multiple stressor theory and modelling, wetland conservation and restoration, socioeconomics, community engagement, management and governance; and involves some of the leading UK experts in these fields. Full research themes and details of the partnership can be found on the EcoWild website (For links see <em>Further information and enquiries</em>). </p><p>The course is available in both full- and part-time study modes. If you are studying full-time, you will spend four years (or eight years if studying part-time) at Oxford working on your DPhil project with your main supervisor. For full-time students, NERC funding will cover three years and eight-months and a comparable proportion of the duration of part-time study. You will have a co-supervisor from one of the other academic partners (Heriot-Watt University, University of York, University of the Highlands and Islands, Centre for Ecology and Hydrology) and a co-supervisor from a non-academic partner (such as Natural England, the Freshwater Biological Association, Scottish Government Marine and Fisheries). Each year you will also receive world class taught training in multi-stressor science and wetland ecology in a mix of in-person cohort-building events and online training. The training is enriched through the active involvement of our associated partners, who contribute to the design and delivery of the programme, organise challenge events, and offer secondments and internships. This provides students with valuable real world experience in addressing environmental problems and working in a professional environment. In addition to specialised training, EcoWild students will attend careers events and established workshops, including for data management, time management, leadership, writing skills and viva preparation, aligning with the Vitae Research Development Framework.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Department of Biology and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Department of Biology.</p><p>Students will meet with the supervisor at least twice a month.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>All students will be initially admitted to the status of Probationer Research Student (PRS). Within a maximum of six terms as a PRS student if studying full-time (around 12 terms if studying part-time), you will be expected to apply for transfer of status from Probationer Research Student to DPhil status. This application is normally made by the fourth term. (likely to be by the eight term for part-time students).</p><p>A successful transfer of status from PRS to DPhil status will require a report that will consist of an introductory part that could become the introduction to the thesis, one rather well-worked analysis of preliminary data representing roughly the equivalent of one thesis chapter, and a plan for the other chapters in the thesis including a detailed timetable. Students who are successful at transfer will also be expected to apply for and gain confirmation of DPhil status to show that your work continues to be on track. This will need to done within nine terms of admission if studying full-time (around 18 terms if studying part-time).</p><p>Both milestones normally involve an interview with two assessors (other than your supervisor) and therefore provide important experience for the final oral examination.</p><p>Full-time students will be expected to submit a substantial thesis of up to 50,000 words after four years from the date of admission (after eight years for part-time students).</p><p>To be successfully awarded a DPhil in Biology you will need to defend your thesis orally (viva voce) in front of two appointed examiners.   </p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>DPhil graduates in biological sciences at Oxford continue to a wide range of careers after graduating. Between 2012 and 2017, 83% of DPhil graduates continued in bioscience-related posts, of which almost three quarters involved academic research.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

You will study this important region, with its rich history and its complex present-day societies, via an intensive language route or a non-language route, culminating in a substantial thesis.", "about": "<div class=\"field-item even\"><div id=\"content-tab\"><p>The MPhil in Modern South Asian Studies is an exciting degree bringing together Oxford’s wealth of expertise on South Asia in a single programme. You will gain access to teaching and expert supervision across departments in the Social Sciences and Humanities Divisions. You will receive rigorous training in one of two tailored modules in research methods, and have the option to build in Hindi, Urdu, Classical Hindi/Hindavi, Persian or other language training.</p><p>You may choose to explore the social, economic and political achievements and challenges of the present-day states of South Asia, and the connections between the countries’ democratic and developmental successes and failures, or to range more broadly across the states and societies of the subcontinent over the past five hundred years.</p><h3>Course structure</h3><p>You will also choose between the language track or the non-language track. Language track students may take one of the following intensive courses both at beginner and advanced level: Hindi, Hindi and Urdu, Classical Hindi/Hindavi, and, if the timetable permits, Sanskrit, Persian or Tibetan. Students who are interested in any of these three 'substitute' core languages are asked to flag this interest in their personal statement.</p><p>Subject to timetabling, students with at least an intermediate or colloquial knowledge of any South Asian language also have the opportunity to take less intensive training in Hindi, Urdu, Classical Hindi/Hindavi or Persian either continuing at an advanced level or beginning a new language. Subject to both timetabling and demand, Bengali, Gujarati or Marathi may be studied either in their modern-day forms at elementary level or in their classical forms at a more advanced level. Again, students interested in taking Persian either at advanced or beginner level are asked to flag this in their personal statement.</p><p>You will experience a variety of teaching modes, including lectures, seminars, classes, student presentations, and small group teaching. The MPhil is jointly taught by staff within the Social Sciences and Humanities Divisions, who will also assess your application. The application process is administered by the Oxford School of Global and Area Studies. Language teaching will be provided in the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies. For much of the course, students will work alongside those taking the nine month MSc in Modern South Asian Studies. For parts of the research methods course, students will be taught alongside those studying for other MPhil and MSc courses offered by the Oxford School of Global and Area Studies, as well as doctoral students, opening up further possibilities for interdisciplinary learning and exchange.</p><p>You will be required to gather relevant materials for your thesis during the course, usually by working in libraries and archives in the UK but potentially also via fieldwork. Required hours of study will vary between students as you will come from different backgrounds and bring different experiences to your study. However, a typical week during term time will involve around 40 hours of study, including two to six hours of scheduled contact hours (more for those following the ‘language track’), two hours for the weekly seminar and at least thirty hours of independent study. In the second year of the MPhil course, the balance changes as students concentrate on the writing up stage of their theses. Success on the course requires sustained effort across the academic year, with term-times being typically prioritised with preparation for, and participation in, course lectures, class presentations, class discussion, essay reviews, and thesis supervisions. The vacation periods are not holidays as such but instead represent extended periods in the academic year when private study and thesis research can be balanced alongside taking a well-earned break during national festivals such as Christmas and Easter. During the summer vacation between the first and second years of the programme you will be expected to undertake at least six weeks’ research in archives or fieldwork as appropriate. </p><h4>First year</h4><p>During the first year, you will attend the core course, introducing modern South Asia across the disciplines. You will also receive training in research methods, through one of the following specially tailored programmes:</p><ul><li>research methods for area studies, both qualitative and quantitative</li><li>research methods in humanities, including qualitative methods in literature, language and history.</li></ul><p>An important purpose of the research methods course is to help you develop and refine your thesis topic.</p><p>You will also choose option papers. If you are taking the language track, you will take one option paper during the first year. If you are taking the non-language track, you will take two option papers. For a full list of option papers, please see the course pages on the department website. Please note that the options will change from time to time, and not all will be run every year.</p><p>By the end of the first year, you will have worked out a thesis proposal, and plans for field or archival work to be undertaken during the summer months between the first and second years.</p><h4>Second year</h4><p>In the second year, you will attend a course on advanced methods, as part of which you will make a presentation of your developing thesis project. Language track students will continue intensive language study. Both language and non-language track students will take an additional option. The major focus of the second year will be the thesis, for which you will receive expert supervision.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies and the Oxford School of Global and Area Studies and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies and the Oxford School of Global and Area Studies.</p><p>All students are assigned a general supervisor at the start of term, who is usually a member of the core teaching staff on the MPhil in Modern South Asian Studies. The role of the general supervisor is to guide you through your course of study. If your research interests fall outside the expertise of your general supervisor, they will assist you in identifying appropriate expertise within the university, and help you approach suitable scholars for supervision. Applicants are advised to consider the research interests of relevant faculty teaching on the programme and to choose a topic where appropriate supervision can be provided. Applicants with a research interest in art history should note that supervision is only available for research that relates specifically to items held in the Ashmolean's collection.</p><p>Depending on the range of your research interests, therefore, it is possible for you to have more than one supervisor - a general supervisor who oversees your general academic progress, and a different supervisor for your thesis. Supervision for the thesis will be offered as a series of individual meetings between you and your thesis supervisor. Your supervisor(s) will discuss your progress, and answer any questions before you submit assessed work. Your thesis supervisor will read one full draft of your thesis provided it is submitted by the deadline agreed (usually Friday of week 8 of Hilary term of your second year).</p><p>In the case of students who require specific help to adjust to an academic programme or to a new range of skills, the supervisor will work with them to ensure that they have additional support.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>In order to receive the MPhil degree, you must obtain pass marks in all components:</p><h4>Language Track (first year)</h4><ol><li>Research Methods (comprising two assignments, one in Michaelmas and one in Hilary term)</li><li>Core Course Essay (submitted at the beginning of Trinity term)</li><li>Core Language Qualifying Assessment</li><li>Option 1</li></ol><h4>Language Track (second year)</h4><ol><li>Core Language Final Assessment</li><li>Option 2</li><li>Thesis (submitted Monday of week 4 of Trinity term)</li></ol><p>In addition to this, you will be required to undertake formative assessment (essays, presentations etc) throughout the programme.</p><h4>Non-language Track (first year)</h4><ol><li>Research Methods (comprising two assignments, one in Michaelmas and one in Hilary term)</li><li>Core Course Essay (submitted at the beginning of Trinity term)</li><li>Option 1</li><li>Option 2</li></ol><h4>Non-language Track (second year)</h4><ol><li>Option 3</li><li>Thesis (submitted Monday of week 4 of Trinity term)</li></ol><p>In addition to this, you will be required to undertake formative assessment (essays, presentations etc) throughout the programme.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>The department aims to equip its graduates with a range of valuable skills which will enable them to compete successfully within a number of different careers - in the civil service and policy-making bodies in Britain, Europe and further afield, in non-governmental organisations concerned with development, in the charitable sector, in journalism, public and private sector research and consultancy, law and academia.

Non-native speaker applicants who think they might qualify for the non-language track who do not have such a degree should explain specifically why they think they qualify, eg through extensive formal study and experience in the region outside the scope of a degree program. Applicants who do not have formal language-study credentials, and particularly applicants who may want to be seen as prospective non-language-track students (including all Hebrew, Persian and Turkish applicants) may wish to submit writing samples that demonstrate the ability to use untranslated sources (preferably written) in a Middle Eastern language.</p><p>Students on the language track take language classes throughout the three terms of the course, plus two optional papers taken in the second and third terms.

This training takes place in classes and language laboratories. In addition to language training, in the first term you are expected to attend the weekly MPhil Qualitative Research Methods for Modern Middle Eastern Studies lecture and seminar, held in the first term. In addition to the lecture, this seminar is an interactive forum in which you are expected to present arguments and to respond to the lecture, associated readings, and each other’s formative essays, which are a crucial element of teaching, but do not count toward the student's final marks. In addition to Qualitative Research Methods, you will be encouraged to attend other lectures and seminars offered by the teaching staff during the first term. You will complete and submit a take-home written assignment based on the Qualitative Research Methods Seminar after the end of the first term which will form the first of two elements of your Qualifying Examination. The second element of the Qualifying Examination is a language qualifying examination taken at the end of the first year (first three terms) of the course.</p><p>In the second term, in consultation with your supervisor, you will attend a series of tutorials for one of three options to be offered for the final examination.

The Faculty of Medieval and Modern Languages is one of the largest centres of its kind in the world and is consistently ranked highly in the QS rankings of Modern Languages departments. You will join a research community spanning medieval studies, early modern literature and culture, through to modern and contemporary literature, film, and cultural history.</p><p>Areas of particular interest that span the faculty's different languages and period specialisms include:</p><ul><li>Cognitive Literary Studies</li><li>Comparative Literature and Translation Studies</li><li>Gender and Diversity</li><li>Ecology and Environmental Humanities</li><li>Medical Humanities and Life Writing</li><li>Performance and Voice</li><li>Postcolonial and Decolonial Studies</li></ul><p>If you wish to proceed to a research degree, the MSt will allow you to work towards the identification of a precise thesis subject and to gather research materials. This degree is also suitable if you do not wish to proceed to a research degree, as it enables you to build upon your undergraduate studies and to reflect on the methods of literary and cultural analysis.</p><h3>Course structure</h3><p>The emphasis in the MSt course is on self-directed learning. You may choose to pursue a single language or study two literatures, including English, comparatively. You may also follow programmes in European enlightenment, cultural studies, or medieval literatures. The course provides a general framework within which you will be encouraged, in conversation with the faculty, to develop your own programme of study, culminating in the dissertation project to be submitted in the final term of the year. The degree comprises three components:</p><h4>Special subject options</h4><p>You will take two special subject options.</p><p>Courses are offered across different language strands and specialisms, subject to the availability of the relevant supervisors in any particular year. Each special subject runs across one of either Michaelmas or Hilary terms, and normally involves four meetings, which, depending on student numbers, may take the form of classes or tutorials. These meetings are normally fortnightly.</p><p>Popular language-specific options include:</p><ul><li>Conscience and Consciousness in French and Francophone Literature.</li><li>Contemporary Brazilian Fiction</li><li>Francophone Literature</li><li>Late Soviet and Post-Soviet Russian Literature</li><li>Latin American Cinema</li><li>Literature and Culture of the Berlin Republic</li><li>Lusophone Women Writers</li><li>Modern Greek Literature in Comparative Frames</li><li>Problems in Dante Interpretation</li><li>Realism and Its Alternatives in Spanish American Narrative</li><li>Women’s Writing in Medieval Germany</li></ul><p>You may also study cross-linguistic comparative options including European Enlightenment, Cultural Studies, Contesting Colonialisms, and Rethinking Subjectivity: Technology, Ecology, Critique, and Fictions. <a href=\"https://www.mod-langs.ox.ac.uk/graduate/mst-modern-languages\">Full listings and further details of courses</a> can be found on the faculty's website.</p><h4>Theoretical or methodological component</h4><p>The theoretical/methodological course runs across during Michaelmas and Hilary terms, and involves a series of hour-long lectures and, depending on student numbers, either seminars or tutorials, lasting up to two hours, in which you will give presentations to your tutor/s and peers. At the end of Hilary term, you will be required to submit an essay for assessment. Students can undertake one of the following courses:</p><ul><li>History of Ideas in Germany from the Eighteenth to the Twentieth Centuries</li><li>Key Questions in Critical Thought</li><li>Palaeography, History of the Book and Digital Humanities</li><li>Spaces of Comparison</li></ul><h4>Dissertation</h4><p>You will complete a dissertation project to be submitted in the final term of the year.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Faculty of Medieval and Modern Languages and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff.

You will choose from a range of options, shared with the MSc in Contemporary Chinese Studies, which allow you opportunities to acquire advanced knowledge of the society, politics, economics, international relations, history, literature and art of modern China.</p><p>Knowing the Chinese language is essential for anyone who wants to understand China and the course is designed to provide this at both elementary and intermediate levels. You will be allocated to the appropriate level by a placement test on arrival.</p><p>Elementary level will be for students who are complete beginners or are false beginners, but not up to the next level. Students are taught reading, writing and translation skills as well as speaking and listening. Intermediate level will be for students who have excelled at the beginner level, are confident in daily communication and able to recognise and write about 500 to 550 Chinese characters. Students must have learnt most of the main grammar points to enter the intermediate level. Due to the intensive language teaching element of the course, this degree is not appropriate for applicants with fluent or native Chinese language ability. Instead they are encouraged to apply for the <a href=\"//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-contemporary-chinese-studies\">MSc in Contemporary Chinese Studies</a> degree.</p><p>The first part of the second year consists of a period of at least three months on an approved course of language study in mainland China or Taiwan. In addition, the second year consists of continued coursework as well as independent research that culminates in a thesis.</p><p>Because this course involves language learning in addition to core and option courses students will have a large number of classroom hours. The exact number of hours per week varies according to the level of language learning. However, whatever the level students will find that most of their time throughout the two years is taken up with classes and the regular preparation and homework required for those classes.</p><p>The overall structure of the course is as follows:</p><ol><li>Chinese Language at level 1 (elementary) or level 2 (intermediate).

It places emphasis on language training as well as on the development of skills in palaeography and codicology. It also offers the opportunity to undertake the acquisition of a medieval language not previously studied. You will follow a core course in research methods and choose from a range of taught option papers. You can also expect to spend at least a third of your time doing independent research with supervisors from at least two disciplines. You will also participate in a variety of workshops and exchanges.</p><p>Teaching comprises:</p><ul><li>compulsory language classes, chosen from a variety of possibilities which normally include (medieval) Latin, Old English, Old Norse, Old French, Old Occitan, Old High German, Middle High German, and Greek. Depending on availability, it may also be possible to arrange tuition in Medieval Welsh, Medieval Irish, Hebrew or Arabic. The language selected should normally be closely related to your work;</li><li>palaeography/codicology classes in one of the participating departments, ie English, history (Medieval Latin), medieval and modern languages;</li><li>option papers, which are courses on short periods or specific themes. The option courses available change from year to year, but the following list is indicative of the types of topics which may be offered by faculties: Saints and Sanctity in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages; The Global Middle Ages; The Twelfth Century Renaissance; Women’s Writing in Medieval Germany; Problems in Dante Interpretation; Myth, History, and the Construction of Identity in Medieval Iberia; Old Norse Literature; Old English Poetry; After the Conquest: Reinventing fiction and history; The Medieval Body and Adornment. </li></ul><p>You will be required to take one option in Michaelmas term and one option in Hilary term;</p><ul><li>seminars, including interdisciplinary seminars which underline the different but complementary approaches to medieval sources offered by different disciplines.

This application is normally made by the third term for full-time students and by the sixth term for part-time students.</p><p>A successful transfer of status from PRS to DPhil status will require submission of a research proposal and a piece of written work, which should be either a chapter of your thesis or an essay related to it. Students who are successful at transfer will also be expected to apply for and gain confirmation of DPhil status to show that your work continues to be on track. This will need to be done within six terms of admission for full-time students and twelve terms of admission for part-time students.</p><p>Both milestones normally involve an interview with two assessors (other than your supervisor) and therefore provide important experience for the final oral examination.</p><p>Full-time students will be expected to submit an original thesis of not more than 80,000 words after three or, at most, four years from the date of admission. If you are studying part-time, you be required to submit your thesis after six or, at most, eight years from the date of admission.

In most cases, students choose a project from our advertised project list, but in some cases, students design their own project in collaboration with their proposed supervisor. In either case, you will be expected to play an active role in shaping your project over the course of the DPhil. Graduate students are a valuable part of the department and they are encouraged to be involved with the scientific and social life of the department at all levels.</p><p>Your project and development during your DPhil studies will be guided by a specialised team led by your academic supervisor.</p><p>Your training will be tailored to your particular needs, drawing from the vast range of training available at Oxford and covering both specialist scientific methods and techniques and transferable skills. Please note that there is no formal taught component of the DPhil in Medical Sciences.</p><p>Much of your training will take place in the lab, where you will be trained by your supervisor or members of the lab team in the variety of techniques and protocols used. A brief statement of the training you will receive in the lab is included in the training description of your <a href=\"https://www.rdm.ox.ac.uk/study-with-us/supervisor-profiles\">chosen project</a>.</p><p>As a member of the Medical Sciences Graduate School you will be entitled to enrol on courses run by the <a href=\"https://www.rdm.ox.ac.uk/study-with-us/skills-and-training\">Medical Sciences Skills Training</a> programme. You will be able to attend the wide variety of sessions covered through the MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine (WIMM) Methods and Techniques course. RDM also runs a successful mentoring scheme, which all students are encouraged to join.</p><h3>Part-time study</h3><p>It is possible to study for a doctorate on a part-time basis. Completing the DPhil on a part-time basis normally requires between six and eight years of study, compared with a full-time DPhil which normally takes three to four years to complete. Part-time study is not suitable for all projects and you will need to check with your supervisor that they are able to accommodate part-time study. </p><p>As a part-time student, attendance is required for a minimum of thirty days of university-based work each year, to be arranged with the agreement of their supervisor, for the period that their names remain on the Register of Graduate Students unless individually dispensed by the Board. During a candidate’s probationary period the attendance arrangements must take account of relevant induction and training events scheduled by the Board. You will have the opportunity to tailor your part-time research in liaison with your supervisor and agree your pattern of attendance.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Radcliffe Department of Medicine and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Radcliffe Department of Medicine.</p><p>As well as your academic supervisor, students also have one or more formal co-supervisors, who can provide additional scientific and/or practical advice in their specialist areas and offer another viewpoint on the student’s project. Together, they form the specialised team that will advise you on your academic progress. Most students usually meet with their supervisor at least once a month.</p><p>You will also have the support of a Graduate Advisor, the Director of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Studies Manager. All activity relating to graduate students within the department is overseen by the Graduate Studies Committee. </p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>All students will be initially admitted to the status of Probationer Research Student (PRS). Within a maximum of six terms as a full-time PRS student or twelve terms as a part-time PRS student, you will be expected to apply for transfer of status from Probationer Research Student to DPhil status. This application is normally made by the fourth term for full-time students and by the eighth term for part-time students.</p><p>A successful transfer of status from PRS to DPhil status will require a written report outlining your project plans and data obtained so far. Students who are successful at transfer will also be expected to apply for and gain confirmation of DPhil status to show that your work continues to be on track. This will need to be done within nine terms of admission for full-time students and eighteen terms of admission for part-time students.</p><p>Both milestones normally involve an interview with two assessors who are not directly involved in your supervision and therefore provide important experience for the final oral examination.</p><p>Full-time students will be expected to submit an original thesis of 50,000 words after three or, at most, four years from the date of admission. If you are studying part-time, you will be required to submit your thesis after six or, at most, eight years from the date of admission. To be successfully awarded a DPhil in Medical Sciences you will need to defend your thesis orally (viva voce) in front of two appointed examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Recent graduates from the DPhil in Medical Sciences have gone on to take up postdoctoral research opportunities within universities and in the pharmaceutical industry. Graduates with previous medical training have continued their clinician- scientist careers both within the University of Oxford and elsewhere.

The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Mathematical Institute and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Mathematical Institute. </p><p>Students are expected to meet with their supervisors at least four times per term. A more typical pattern is weekly, at least until you reach the stage of writing up your thesis.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>All students will be initially admitted to the status of Probationer Research Student (PRS). Within four terms of admission as a PRS student you will be expected to apply for transfer of status from Probationer Research Student to DPhil status.</p><p>A successful transfer of status from PRS to DPhil status will require satisfactory attendance and the submission of a thesis. Students who are successful at transfer will also be expected to apply for and gain confirmation of DPhil status within nine terms of admission, to verify that their work continues to be on track. Both milestones normally involve an interview with two assessors (other than your supervisor) and therefore provide important experience for the final oral examination.</p><p>You will be expected to teach at least one set of classes before transfer of status and a further two additional sets before confirmation of status. You will be expected to acquire transferable skills as part of your training and to undertake 68 hours of broadening courses outside your specialist area. This normally involves the submission of written work for three 16-hour lecture courses and attendance at workshops and colloquia.</p><p>You will be expected to submit a substantial original thesis which should not exceed 200 pages after three or, at most, four years from the date of admission. To be successfully awarded a Doctor of Philosophy in Mathematics you will need to defend your thesis orally (viva voce) in front of two appointed examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>The department, working alongside the university’s Careers Service, supports graduate students as they move from the DPhil to the next stage of their career. Many graduate students stay in academia, by taking up a postdoctoral position, and many move into employment in a range of industries and sectors where the expertise and skills developed during the DPhil are highly valued.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

The course is structured around four five-day residences and two online modules.", "about": "<div class=\"field-item even\"><div id=\"content-tab\"><p>Based in Oxford, and taking full advantage of the remarkable resources that this university has at its disposal, the Literature and Arts course is designed around three sequential periods of British history: the early modern period (c 1500-1700), the ‘long’ eighteenth century (c 1688-1800), and the ‘long’ nineteenth century (c 1800-1914). British history is understood in an expansive sense that includes Britain’s relationships with the rest of the world.</p><p>By studying each period through the lens of multiple disciplines, you will have the opportunity to acquire a multi-faceted picture of the past and explore connections between different aspects of British culture and society. In this framework giant achievements such as Shakespeare’s plays or Turner’s art can be understood not only as uniquely inspired works but also as products of their times and influences on future developments.</p><p>The MSt in Literature and Arts (MLA) is a two-year, part-time course.</p><p>In year one, there are three compulsory five-day residences and one online module consisting of nine units (Core course two).</p><p>In year two, there is one compulsory residence and one online module (Core course three).</p><p>Although the online modules are not assessed, it is a requirement that you engage with the online modules to the satisfaction of the course director. The online modules are fully supported by a dedicated Virtual Learning Environment.</p><p>Students are supported by tutorials with the course director before or during each residence, input from the course director in asynchronous discussions in the online modules, supervision from tutors in relation to each assignment, and supervision from a dissertation supervisor or supervisors. The course director is also able to offer support at any time throughout the course by email/phone.</p><p>After taking a broad view of British history and culture in a global context at the first residence (Core course one), the three subsequent residences enable you to choose from a range of subjects, each rooted in one of the core disciplines of literature, history, history of art and material culture, and philosophy. You will take two options out of four offered. Please note that due to timetabling constraints it may not always be possible to allocate you to your first and second choices.</p><p>For Residence two, which is focused on the early modern period, the options offered are likely to include ‘Sacred Monsters: Shakespeare in History’, ‘Tudor Monarchy’, and ‘The Elizabethan Country House’.</p><p>For Residence three, which is focused on the ‘long’ eighteenth century, the options offered are likely to be ‘Green Retreats: Nature and Landscape in Eighteenth-Century Literature’, ‘Overseas Trade and the Rise of Britain as a Superpower’, ‘The Rise of Landscape in British Painting’, and ‘Bentham, Hume and Eighteenth-Century British Philosophy’.</p><p>For Residence four, which is focused on the ‘long’ nineteenth century, the options offered are likely to include ‘Fiction c 1800-1820’, ‘History, Historiography and Medievalism: The Victorians and the Crusades’, and ‘The British Empire and the Country House’. It cannot be guaranteed that any particular option will be offered.</p><p>Each residence will comprise a full timetable of lectures and seminars in the mornings and afternoons. In keeping with the Oxford ethos of tutorial instruction, individual tutorials and supervisions will also be an integral part of the course, most notably with regard to the dissertation. Individual supervision will be undertaken both face-to-face and by email. It is generally expected that the ratio of taught content to self-directed learning will be 1:18.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Department for Continuing Education and this role will usually be performed by the course director.</p><p>It is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Where appropriate a supervisor may be found outside the Department for Continuing Education.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>Assessment is through four assignments, each assignment following a residential session, and a dissertation. The four assignments contribute 40% of the final mark and the dissertation contributes 60%.</p><p>A computer and reliable internet connection will be required as there are two compulsory online components of the course.</p><p>The minimum recommended <a href=\"https://onlinesupport.conted.ox.ac.uk/my-computerdevice/\">IT specification</a> can be found on the department's online support website.

Usually this course is intended for students who have already completed the <a href=\"//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/mst-literature-and-arts\">MSt in Literature and Arts</a>, although other suitably qualified students who have completed a master’s degree in the humanities may also apply. Students will often be building on research and skills developed during the MSt in Literature and Arts.</p><p>The DPhil programme shares the same historical and multi-disciplinary scope as the MSt. It may encompass the disciplines of literature, art and architectural history, history, and history of ideas.</p><p>Compared to the MSt, however, students will be working independently towards their own deeply researched 100,000 word thesis, building on sustained independent research over a number of years, and focusing on a specific subject in depth.</p><p>Admission is through the Department for Continuing Education. All graduate students on this course will be members of the department’s Graduate School. The part-time DPhil regulations normally require a minimum of four years' part-time study, equivalent to twelve terms, up to a maximum of eight years part-time study.</p><p>As a part-time student you will be required to attend course activities and related obligations in Oxford for a minimum of 30 days each year.</p><p>There will be flexibility in the dates of attendance, which will be determined by mutual agreement with your supervisor. You will have the opportunity to tailor your part-time study and pattern of in-person attendance in liaison with your supervisor. It is expected that you will join all online course activities during your period of study.</p><p>You will be strongly encouraged to participate in seminars and meetings with staff and other researchers in the University of Oxford. The major commitment of your time will be to individual study and research, involving wide and intense reading, collection of primary evidence, analysis and writing. You will be expected to attend and to contribute to the wide range of research seminars, conferences and workshops organised in the University. You will also have access to specialist training courses offered by the Bodleian Library and IT services.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Department for Continuing Education and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff.

Please refer to the Department for Continuing Education website to see the areas of expertise and supervision offered for this course. Your supervisor will help you to develop a programme of research and writing although a research proposal should be at a well developed stage at the time of application.</p><p>Students on the DPhil are required to attend a minimum of 30 days of university-based work each year for the duration of their studies, usually that involves meeting their supervisor at least once a term.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>You will be admitted initially as a Probationary Research Student (PRS), in line with University regulations on doctorates. During the probationary period, you will develop and begin work on the thesis topic. You will develop research skills through a range of training and skills development primarily offered via the Department for Continuing Education Graduate School, as well as across the University.</p><p>Students must apply for a Transfer of Status from PRS to DPhil status between the sixth and the eighth academic term after admission, each academic year at Oxford having three terms. This involves the submission of a piece of written work that is examined by two assessors, neither of whom will be your supervisors. This process is to ensure that your work is of potential DPhil quality and that the methodology of the research is appropriate and feasible. Upon successful completion of the Transfer of Status, you would usually undertake a period of primary fieldwork/data collection over one to two years.</p><p>You will also be required to apply for a Confirmation of Status as DPhil sometime between the twelfth and eighteenth term after admission. This will also involve the submission of a piece of written work that is assessed by two assessors, neither of whom will be your supervisors. The Confirmation of Status assessment is different to the Transfer of Status assessment as the assessors will be focusing on how the research is progressing, the quality of the draft chapters/papers, and on the plan for completion. The assessors will be looking to ensure that you are making the appropriate amount of progress in the development of your thesis, so that thesis submission will be achieved within the time limit.</p><p>You will be expected to submit a deeply researched 100,000 word thesis after eighteen or, at most, twenty-four terms from the date of admission. To be successfully awarded a DPhil in Literature and Arts you will need to defend your thesis orally (viva voce) in front of two appointed examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Support in making decisions about graduate destinations will be provided by the course team.

It witnessed the transformation of the ancient Roman and Iranian empires into their more centralised, more bureaucratic late Roman and Sassanian successors. This was a time of the consolidation of ancient philosophy, Judaism, and Christianity, as well as the emergence of Islam. By the end of the period, the ancient world order had dissolved into a series of Western kingdoms, the Islamic caliphate, and the Byzantine state focused on Constantinople. Over more than a millennium of history, Byzantium (c.330-c.1453) was central to political, economic, and cultural networks across the Eurasian continent, and played a crucial part in the formation of Eastern Christendom, the Crusades, and the Renaissance.</p><p>This course introduces you to this rich heritage, while also allowing for a high level of specialisation in various periods, regions, and source types; as well as languages (incl. Greek, Latin, Syriac, Arabic, Armenian, Coptic, and Persian) and approaches (incl. History, Archaeology, Visual Culture, Literature, and Religion). Uniquely, the course is taught through a team of scholars based in several different Oxford faculties: History, Classics, Archaeology, Theology and Religion, Asian and Middle Eastern Studies, and Modern and Medieval Languages.</p><p>Oxford scholars have been vital to the formation of Late Antiquity and Byzantium as modern academic disciplines. As a postgraduate in Late Antique and Byzantine Studies you will join a thriving and active community of over one hundred scholars and students, represented in the <a href=\"https://www.ocla.ox.ac.uk/\">Oxford Centre for Late Antiquity</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.ocbr.ox.ac.uk/\">Oxford Centre for Byzantine Research</a>. These centres help to organise a regular programme of seminars and conferences, while the <a href=\"https://oxfordbyzantinesociety.wordpress.com/\">Oxford University Byzantine Society</a> runs an annual postgraduate research trip to different parts of the former late antique and Byzantine worlds, and a conference which gathers postgraduates from across the globe.</p><h3>Core courses</h3><p>Although the two components of the course, Late Antiquity and Byzantium, have been designed to the same specification and are conjoined in a single course, you are expected to concentrate on <strong>one</strong> of the fields only.</p><p>In the first two terms you will follow:</p><ul><li>a weekly class in <em>either</em> Late Antique <em>or</em> Byzantine History; and</li><li>in the first term, a second weekly class in Late Antique and Byzantine Archaeology and Visual Culture; and</li><li>in the second term, a weekly class in Late Antique and Byzantine Religion.</li></ul><h4>Late Antique History</h4><p>This course, which comprises sixteen classes over the first two terms, encompasses the whole chronological and geographical span of the Late Roman Empire and beyond. Taught through a mix of student- and teacher-led sessions, it aims to explore facets of the late antique world against wider themes such as religious, cultural, and political change, while also familiarising you with different source types and methodologies. Examples of topics covered in recent years include: Urbanism, Successor Kingdoms, Monasticism, Elite housing and art, Late Roman empresses, Splinter empires and usurpers, Poetry, Magical and philosophical texts, Sassanid Persia, Law, Military handbooks, Goths, Natural disasters and narratives, Travel, and Papyrus documents.</p><h4>Byzantine History</h4><p>Taught each week over the first two terms, this sixteen-class course introduces you to the world of medieval Byzantium and its neighbours. Operating with a generous definition of the horizons of Byzantine history, it normally progresses chronologically from the reign of Justinian to the fall of Constantinople (depending on students’ interests), and focuses on critical debates within Byzantine and wider medieval studies. Through a combination of short lectures, student presentations, and group debate, it exposes you to a range of methodological approaches to, sources for, and scholarship on the medieval East. Recent classes have included: Justinian and political dissent, the Justinianic plague and environmental history, the Rise of Islam, Church councils and the papacy, Byzantine law, Iconoclasm, Cultural exchange with the caliphate, Arab geographers on Byzantium, Slavery, Byzantium and Rus’, the Eleventh-century ‘crisis’, Komnenian historiography, the Seljuks, the Crusades and 1204, the Empire of Nicaea, and the Zealots.</p><h4>Late Antique and Byzantine Archaeology and Visual Culture</h4><p>The archaeology and visual culture course consists of eight three-hour long sessions in the first term. Through a combination of brief lectures, class-based discussions, class-presentations, and museum visits, it introduces you to the main methods of Late antique and Byzantine archaeology and visual culture, and explores current research themes. It is foremost intended to make students familiar with the specificity of the source material, teach you how to look at, analyse and describe material and visual culture as well as explore diverse ways in which you can make use of this evidence for your own research papers. Methodological insights are applied to various topics, including Urbanism, Reuse of building materials, Architecture and power, Light and lighting in Byzantium, Late antique and Byzantine capital cities, Byzantine perceptions of neighbouring societies, Cappadocia, Pilgrimage, The origin and workings of icons.</p><h4>Late Antique and Byzantine Religion</h4><p>Taught in the second term through student-led presentations and group discussion, this course of eight classes introduces you to prominent aspects of theology and religion within the late antique and Byzantine worlds. Organised thematically so as to encompass the various regional and chronological specialisms of attendees, the classes range across the diverse religious traditions of the period (incl. polytheism, Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Zoroastrianism, and Manichaeism), while introducing you to the various sources and methodologies available to students of theology and religion. Recent class topics have included Apocalyptic, Asceticism, Conversion, Councils, Dualism, Hagiography, Heresy, Holy women, Iconoclasm, Liturgy, Mysticism, Relics, and Religious art.</p><h3>Training pathways</h3><p>Alongside the choice between Late Antique or Byzantine History, you must also choose between two training pathways, dependent on your knowledge of languages or your primary interests in the field.</p><p>You must also choose <em>one</em> of the following training pathways:</p><h4>Language pathway</h4><p>The first is the language training pathway, which offers intensive training in any one of the following ancient and medieval languages and, normally, their associated literatures: Greek, Latin, Old Church Slavonic, Armenian, Syriac, Coptic, Arabic, Middle Persian, and Hebrew.</p><h4>Skills pathway</h4><p>The second pathway is designed for those who already have considerable competence in their chosen language(s) and are able to read primary sources in the original. You will receive instruction in one or two of a range of specialist auxiliary disciplines: papyrology, epigraphy, palaeography, numismatics, sigillography or artefact studies. You will also write a 10,000-word dissertation on a subject of your choosing.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Faculty of History and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor outside the Faculty of History may be nominated.</p><p>An Oxford academic’s pre-application indication of willingness to supervise an enquiring applicant is not a guarantee that the applicant will be offered a place, or that the supervisor in question has capacity in that particular year.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>Examination comprises several parts depending on the chosen pathway:</p><p>All students submit two essays on a topic of your choosing, subject to the approval of your supervisor. The first is submitted in the second term; the second in the third term. You can find examples of previous essay titles on the <a href=\"//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/humanities/history\">Faculty of History website</a>.</p><p>If you select the language pathway, you will take a language paper; and a literature paper in the same language.</p><p>If you select the skills pathway, you will take a paper or papers in the chosen auxiliary disciplines; and a dissertation on a topic of your choosing, subject to the approval of your supervisor, and submitted in the third term.</p><p>Language, Literature, and auxiliary disciplines are taught throughout the year, and will normally be examined by unseen examinations at the end of the third term.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>About a quarter of master’s students proceed to doctoral work at Oxford; others continue academic study at other institutions. Other career destinations are as diverse as, but broadly in line with, undergraduate history career destinations: law, finance, management consultancy, civil service etc.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

Methodological insights are applied to various topics, including Urbanism, Reuse of building materials, Architecture and power, Light and lighting in Byzantium, Late antique and Byzantine capital cities, Byzantine perceptions of neighbouring societies, Cappadocia, Pilgrimage, The origin and workings of icons.</p><h4>Theology and Religion</h4><p>Taught in the <strong>second term</strong> through student-led presentations and group discussion, this course of eight classes introduces you to prominent aspects of theology and religion within the late antique and Byzantine worlds. Organised thematically so as to encompass the various regional and chronological specialisms of attendees, the classes range across the diverse religious traditions of the period (incl. polytheism, Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Zoroastrianism, and Manichaeism), while introducing you to the various sources and methodologies available to students of theology and religion. Recent class topics have included Apocalyptic, Asceticism, Conversion, Councils, Dualism, Hagiography, Heresy, Holy women, Iconoclasm, Liturgy, Mysticism, Relics, and Religious art.</p><h3>Year one - training pathways</h3><p>Alongside the choice between Late Antique or Byzantine History, you must also choose between two training pathways, dependent on your knowledge of languages or your primary interests in the field.</p><p>You must also choose <em>one</em> of the following training pathways:</p><h4>Language pathway</h4><p>The first is the language training pathway, which offers intensive training in any one of the following ancient and medieval languages and, normally, their associated literatures: Greek, Latin, Old Church Slavonic, Armenian, Syriac, Coptic, Arabic, Middle Persian, and Hebrew. Please note that not every subject listed may be on offer every year, depending in part on levels of student demand. </p><h4>Skills pathway</h4><p>The second is the skills pathway, and is designed for those who already have considerable competence in their chosen language(s) and are able to read primary sources in the original. You will receive instruction in one or two of a range of specialist auxiliary disciplines: papyrology, epigraphy, palaeography, numismatics, sigillography or artefact studies. Please note that not every subject listed may be on offer every year, depending in part on levels of student demand. You will also write a dissertation on a subject of your choosing.</p><h3>Year two</h3><h4>Thesis </h4><p>In the second year you will write a thesis on a topic of your choosing, subject to the approval of your supervisor. This will be submitted in the third term. Examples of MPhil thesis titles can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.history.ox.ac.uk/mst-mphil-late-antique-and-byzantine-studies\">History Faculty website</a>.</p><h4 id=\"disciplines\">Dissertation, Auxiliary Discipline(s), or Language Paper</h4><p>In the second year you will also choose one other examined element. Either:</p><ul><li>a dissertation on a topic of your choosing, subject to the approval of your supervisor, and submitted in the third term; or</li><li>one or two auxiliary disciplines (from papyrology, epigraphy, palaeography, numismatics, sigillography or artefact studies); or</li><li>a language paper (from Greek, Latin, Old Church Slavonic, Armenian, Syriac, Coptic, Arabic, Middle Persian, and Hebrew).</li></ul><p>Language, Literature, and auxiliary disciplines are taught throughout the year, and will normally be examined by unseen examinations at the end of the third term.</p><p>Please note that not every every subject area listed may be on offer every year, depending in part on levels of student demand.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Faculty of History and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor outside the Faculty of History may be nominated.</p><p>An Oxford academic’s pre-application indication of willingness to supervise an enquiring applicant is not a guarantee that the applicant will be offered a place, or that the supervisor in question has capacity in that particular year.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><h4>Year one</h4><p>Examination comprises several parts depending on the chosen pathway:</p><p>All students submit two essays on a topic of your choosing, subject to the approval of your supervisor. The first is submitted in the second term; the second in the third term. You can find examples of previous essay titles on the faculty's website.</p><p>If you select the language pathway, you will take a language paper; and a literature paper in the same language.</p><p>If you select the skills pathway, you will take a paper or papers in the chosen auxiliary disciplines; and a dissertation on a topic of your choosing, subject to the approval of your supervisor, and submitted in the third term.</p><h4>Year two</h4><p>In the second year you will write a thesis on a topic of your choosing, subject to the approval of your supervisor. This is submitted in the third term.</p><p>You will also be examined an one other element of your choosing, either:</p><ul><li>a dissertation on a topic of your choosing, subject to the approval of your supervisor, and submitted in the third term; or</li><li>one or two auxiliary disciplines (from a list of subject areas - see <a href=\"#disciplines\"><em>Dissertation, Auxiliary Discipline(s), or Language Paper</em></a> for examples); or</li><li>a language paper (from a list of subject areas - see <a href=\"#disciplines\"><em>Dissertation, Auxiliary Discipline(s), or Language Paper</em></a> for examples).</li></ul><p>Language, Literature, and auxiliary disciplines are taught throughout the year, and will normally be examined by unseen examinations at the end of the third term.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>About a quarter of master’s students proceed to doctoral work at Oxford; others continue academic study at other institutions. Other career destinations are as diverse as, but broadly in line with, undergraduate history career destinations: law, finance, management consultancy, civil service etc.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

This provides training in legal research methodology, but it will also expose you to the diversity of and intellectual challenges involved in legal scholarship and serves as a forum of peers in which you can discuss the methodological challenges involved in your own research. The course comprises seven compulsory two-hour seminars during Michaelmas term while in Hilary term, students must attend eight hours of seminars from a wider range of options, including seminars offered by other social sciences departments and the faculty’s Centres for Criminology and Socio-Legal Studies. Students must also attend the course conference at the start of Trinity term.</p><p>The Faculty can provide supervision for a wide range of different topics and a <a href=\"https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/current-students/completed-dphil-projects\">list of completed doctorates</a> gives a general sense of the breadth and depth of the research undertaken by its students.</p><p>A typical week for a student during their first two terms will involve attendance at a legal research training methodology class and perhaps participating in a discussion group (of which there are over 30) or auditing a BCL seminar that relates to their own research topic; apart from which they will be spending their time engaged in their own research. You will also meet with supervisors to discuss your work as explained in the supervision section below. After the third term (providing you transfer to full DPhil status) you may undertake fieldwork and research trips, depending on the nature of your research topics, and there may be opportunities to undertake paid research assistance or to teach undergraduate students.</p><p>If you are a part-time student, you will be required to be physically present in Oxford for a minimum of 30 days per year, normally coinciding with the full terms of the academic year, to be arranged with the agreement of your supervisor. You should expect to meet with your supervisor (either in person or, where available, online) up to nine times throughout the academic year, and in the first two terms, you will be required to undertake the legal research training methodology course (either in person or, where available, online).</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Law Faculty and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Law Faculty.</p><p>On admission as a research student, you will be assigned a supervisor with whom you should meet regularly to discuss your work and provide feedback and advice.  Students generally meet their supervisors nine times per year. For the DPhil, there is likely to be a greater concentration of meetings during the first two terms, while you are in the process of defining your research topic, and in the final stages leading up to submission of the completed thesis.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>All students will be initially admitted to the status of Probationer Research Student (PRS). Within a maximum of four terms as a full-time PRS student (eight terms as a part-time PRS student), you will be expected to apply for, and achieve, transfer of status from Probationer Research Student to DPhil status by submitting a research outline and a substantial piece of written work. These are assessed by two members of the Law Faculty, who will also interview you about your work. This application is normally made by the third term for full-time students (sixth term for part-time students). A similar exercise then takes place between your sixth and ninth terms (twelfth and fifteenth terms for the part-time pathway) when you will apply for Confirmation of DPhil status.</p><p>After three or at most four years (no later than eight years for the part-time pathway), your thesis will be read by two examiners, who conduct an in-depth oral examination known as a viva voce. The thesis must make a significant and substantial contribution to its field. On the basis of the examiners’ report, you will either be awarded the DPhil (which may be subject to major or minor corrections) or referred back to make revisions to the thesis.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>DPhil students will pursue a range of career paths after completion of the doctorate. Many will take up academic posts, or pursue postdoctoral research of one sort or another. Some will enter legal practice as solicitors, barristers, advocates, and judges; others will become legal advisors advising government departments, non-governmental organisations and private companies.</p><p>The University of Oxford has an excellent careers service with which the department has close ties. The Careers Service organises a number of events of specific interest to students wishing to pursue a career in law, and offers one-to-one advice from members of staff with knowledge and experience specific to the legal sector.</p><p>The Law Faculty has an extensive network of relationships within the legal profession and each year offers a number of talks and events run by law firms and barristers’ chambers.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

The course is made possible by a donation from the Recanati-Kaplan Foundation, and is jointly managed with the Department for Continuing Education.</p><p>The focus of the course is on methods commonly used in the study of large mammals, and especially carnivores, in the developing world. The curriculum consists of modules on wildlife ecology, monitoring and survey techniques, GIS and habitat assessment, population management and statistics, as well as two reports which together complete an independent research project. The mode of teaching in the modules consists mostly of lectures, group discussions, technical practicals on the use of computer software, field sessions, tutorials and (group) workshops.</p><p>The independent research project concentrates on the organisation, analysis and reporting of previously collected data that you bring with you or is provided by WildCRU researchers. There is no time to undertake primary data collection in country or abroad during the course duration. The project is divided into two phases: Phase One consists of a literature and methods review and a section containing data exploration; Phase Two builds upon this but also includes the full data analysis and discussion of results. Unifying threads running through the course are the global and human dimensions of biodiversity conservation. You will learn both the theory and practical aspects of field techniques, so that you can confidently adopt them in the future, as well as critically evaluate other projects.</p><p>Within the eight-month course the first month will consist of mostly self-paced distance learning, then a three month phase which consists predominantly of taught material, while the remaining four months is a mix between taught material and independent work on projects.</p><p>Up to eight students are accepted each year and applications are particularly welcomed from conservationists working in economically less-developed parts of the world, for whom need-based scholarships are available. Suitable candidates are early-career field conservationists, working with government agencies or NGOs, who will implement and disseminate their skills to their home countries.</p><p>Please note that the course is not suitable for individuals who are not currently working in an ecology or conservation research role.

The programme has received the highest level of recognition in UK national and global assessment exercises. It is a community from which you will draw support and guidance but which will also learn from your own contribution to its work.</p><p>You will have rich opportunities for connecting with fellow-students, postdoctoral fellows, and temporary and permanent academic staff involved in disciplinary and cross-disciplinary research programmes. The department attracts many of the world’s leading figures in International Relations (IR) - as visiting scholars, speakers in the regular IR Colloquium, and participants in research conferences and workshops.</p><p>Doctoral students spend the first year of full-time study, or the first two years of part-time study, in the development of, and early work on, the thesis topic; in improving knowledge of quantitative and qualitative research methods; in attendance at relevant lectures, seminars and classes; and in preparing to transfer from Probationary Research Student (PRS - the status at which you will normally be admitted - see Assessment) to full DPhil status.</p><p>An academic supervisor will advise and guide you as you progress through the different stages of your doctoral research. In addition to work for your supervisor, you will be required to take a range of coursework. In the first term this includes: Research Design and Methods (RDM) in IR, Research Design, and introductory or intermediate statistics, as well as attendance at the regular IR DPhil Research Seminar which runs through the year and at which doctoral students present their work. In the second term students continue with RDM in IR and take one course in Formal Analysis, Causal Inference or Qualitative Methods. In the third term, there are a series of short, specialised methods courses. For part-time students, these coursework obligations are distributed across six terms.</p><p>Exemptions from particular elements of the coursework can be sought on the basis of previous training. Subsequent years are largely devoted to the development of the thesis project.</p><p>Doctoral theses will normally require substantial original research, often involving archives, fieldwork, interviewing or other forms of data generation and collection. For the doctoral degree the most crucial requirement is that the thesis makes a ‘significant and substantial contribution to the field of knowledge within which it falls’. There are many ways of achieving this.</p><p>The department is committed to the rigorous use of a plurality of methods. There are many different ways of conducting research for a thesis. Any or all may be valid in a given case, depending on the subject of the research and the questions addressed. Some theses may involve an analytical-descriptive attempt at understanding different events, perspectives and traditions of thought. Others may have a strong historiographical element - exploring, for example, the relation between events and ideas, or involving an original and expert use of sources. Others may involve advancing a hypothesis about a subject and then testing it with a range of qualitative and/or quantitative approaches. Apart from meeting the highest scholarly standards, there is no set template. There is also a strong and successful tradition of normative and critical work. Oxford IR seeks to combine the best of North American political science with deep engagement with the international relations of different parts of the world and with the history of different traditions of thought on the subject.</p><p>As a doctoral student of the department, you will have access to outstanding library and computing resources within the Social Sciences Division (of which the Department of Politics and IR is a major part), elsewhere in the University and, in most cases, in your college. The division runs network events to enable DPhil students to meet and network with their colleagues not only within politics and IR but with other social science disciplines.</p><p>As a part-time student you will be required to attend classes, seminars, supervision meetings and other obligations in Oxford for a minimum of thirty days each year.<br/>There will be limited flexibility in the dates and pattern of attendance. Attendance will be required during term-time at least one day each week throughout the first two years of your study on days determined by your class and seminar attendance and by your supervisor. Attendance will be required outside of term-time on dates to be determined by mutual agreement with your supervisor.<br/>You will be required to attend fieldwork and training sessions on dates to be determined by mutual agreement with your supervisor.</p><p>Successful completion of an Oxford DPhil requires an intense and sustained level of personal motivation and focus within a world-class research and teaching environment.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Department of Politics and International Relations and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Supervisors are usually selected from the <a href=\"https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/people.html?cat=14&amp;lang=en&amp;search=academic_profiles&amp;task=search\">academic staff</a> within the Department of Politics and International Relations. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Department of Politics and International Relations. </p><p>You will be assigned an academic supervisor who will advise and guide you as you progress through the different stages of your doctoral research. </p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>Applicants are admitted to the DPhil with Probationer Research Student (PRS) status. As a PRS, you will develop your research proposal and skills, complete a programme of assessed research methods coursework, and produce a draft section or sections of the thesis, in order to apply for the Transfer of Status that will end your probationary period as a research student. The Graduate Studies Committee will require satisfactory completion of this training programme as a condition of your change of status from PRS to DPhil.</p><p>Once you have been admitted to full DPhil status, you must achieve confirmation of that status by the end of your ninth term as a full-time doctoral student, or by the end of your eighteenth term as a part-time student. Once you have completed your thesis, you will be examined <em>viva voce</em>.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>International Relations has an outstanding placement record. The largest group of DPhil students go on to careers in academia or research. Many move on to post-doctoral fellowships in the UK, continental Europe and North America. Our doctoral students have a distinguished history of winning thesis and other prizes and of publishing their work in leading journals and with major university presses. The universities at which IR graduates have gained academic positions over recent years include: ANU, McGill, Waterloo, Sciences Po, Amsterdam, Groningen, The Graduate Institute Geneva, SAIS/JHU, ETH Zürich, The New School, Swarthmore, LSE, Oxford, Cambridge, King’s College London, University College London, Queen Mary London, St Andrews, Exeter, Reading, Warwick, PUC Santiago, and FGV São Paulo. Oxford IR DPhils also work at all levels in many of world’s leading think-tanks and research institutes in Europe and North America but also in Brazil, South Africa, and Singapore. Others still have moved to achieve leading positions in the policy and political world.

The curriculum places equal emphasis on the substance of human rights law, its implementation and research. </p><p>Students come from all over the world and from a variety of advocacy settings; from various international and non-governmental organisations, governments, universities, foundations, the media, the armed forces, medicine and other fields and from private and corporate practice. The faculty is also diverse and includes internationally recognised human rights scholars and advocates. The programme seeks the widest possible diversity among both students and tutors.</p><p>The first period of distance learning comprises guided online study over two terms, with each of its units including reading periods followed by tutor-guided asynchronous seminars supplemented by some live encounters.</p><p>For the second period of distance learning students work independently on researching and writing their dissertation with one-to-one online support from their supervisor.</p><p>For both periods of distance learning, students will require consistent, ready and reliable internet access.</p><p>Summer residentials in Oxford comprise three weeks of tutor-led small group seminars plus a week for independent revision and two exams. In addition, the first summer session includes dissertation-related exercises to prepare students for the independent dissertation work they will undertake in their second year.</p><p>Past students have found it beneficial to immerse themselves within the MSc in International Human Rights Law community during the residential sessions. If your personal circumstances permit therefore, we strongly encourage you to consider booking your accommodation during the residential sessions with New College, which will be facilitated by the course organisers. This may help you to benefit from what the course offers in terms of additional opportunities for discursive engagement and networking. Lunches and dinners are already included in the course fee and will also be provided at New College. If you have any concerns around this, for example regarding dietary restrictions, please get in touch with the Course Administrator to discuss them.</p><h3>Course content</h3><p>The course is undertaken part-time over a period of 24 months. It comprises one compulsory course – the Fundamentals of International Human Rights Law course, taken online in the first year - and four electives, two per year, taken in-person at the summer residence. Electives will be selected from a list of options. Not all are offered every year.</p><p>Previous options have included:</p><ul><li>Business and Human Rights</li><li>International Rights of Children</li><li>International Criminal Law</li><li>Economic Social and Cultural Rights</li><li>Domesticating International Human Rights Law</li><li>Human Rights and Environmental Law</li><li>International Humanitarian Law</li><li>Racial Discrimination, Minorities and Indigenous Peoples</li><li>Right to Life</li><li>Refugees, Asylum Seekers and Human Rights</li><li>Comparative Regional Human Rights Systems</li><li>Religion and Human Rights</li><li>Transitional Justice</li><li>International Rights of Women and Gender-Related Discrimination.</li></ul><p>In addition, students submit a dissertation on a topic of their choice related to international human rights law in their second year. The topic must be approved by the course examiners.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>An important person in helping your intellectual development during the degree programme will be your academic supervisor. This person will oversee your academic work and submit progress reports.</p><p>For the first three terms of your degree, your academic supervisor will be your tutor for the online Fundamentals of International Human Rights Law course. For the next two terms, your academic supervisor will be the person allocated to supervise your dissertation. The allocation is dependent on the subject area of your dissertation. For the final term, your supervisor is expected to be another Oxford University faculty member.</p><p>For this course, the allocation of graduate supervision is the responsibility of the Law Faculty and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff.</p><p>Efforts will be made to meet the preferences of graduate students to work with a particular member of the course team for the dissertation. Tutors and supervisors join as academic contributors to the programme from around the world, and there is therefore a wide range of experts supporting its offerings.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>The degree is assessed by coursework (20%), examinations (50%) and a dissertation (30%).</p><p>Your first period of distance learning is assessed by way of assignments, and the second by way of a dissertation. You will sit two examinations during each of the two summer residentials.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Students have gone on to work as prosecutors and defence lawyers at the International Criminal Court, other UN criminal tribunals, and various regional human rights bodies. They work in private and multi-national corporate practice; in various ministries in their national governments and as UN officials ranging from refugee legal protection officers to country representatives. Others are judges, university professors, lawyers with their national armed forces, heads of NGOs and journalists.</p><p>Graduates from the course also include economists, obstetricians, epidemiologists, psychiatrists and forensic anthropologists. They are senior advisors in government around the world, Foreign Ministries, Defence Ministries and each and every one of the regional human rights bodies. They are defence counsel at Guantanamo Bay, do front-line community work in Afghanistan and emergency co-ordination in Sudan, Haiti and many other places. They represent indigenous peoples in northern Canada, Western Australia, the Philippines and Brazil.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

These papers are chosen from the syllabus for the faculty's BA in Theology and Religion and cover four major subject areas:</p><ul><li>biblical studies</li><li>systematic theology and ethics</li><li>history of religions, including Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam and Judaism</li><li>religion and religions, including contemporary Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and Judaism.</li></ul><p>You might choose to study a range of papers from across these areas, for example, on aspects of the New Testament, Hebrew Bible, the nature of religion or modern doctrine. Alternatively, you might prefer to focus on a single area, for example, the sources and formations of Hinduism, modern Hinduism and further studies in Hinduism or in feminist approaches to religion.</p><p>There is a wide range of options available but please note that not all options will be available every year. If studying part-time, you will enrol on two papers in your first year of study, and the third (and fourth, if this option is chosen) in your second year. </p><p>Teaching for the Postgraduate Diploma in Theology and Religion is organised by your Director of Studies, appointed by the faculty, who may or may not be based in your college or Permanent Private Hall. Your Director of Studies will arrange for some or all of your teaching to be undertaken by other members of academic staff, but will retain overall responsibility for your progress.</p><p>The course is mainly taught via tutorials, for which you would customarily spend one week preparing written work, with the aid of a reading list provided by your tutor, followed by a meeting to discuss this written work with your tutor for approximately one hour. The tutorial format thus includes both self-directed and supported learning elements, but it is weighted towards self-direction. You will also attend relevant classes and lectures as advertised for the BA in Theology and Religion, as well as seminars organised specifically for Postgraduate Diploma students (usually two per term). The events offer supported learning opportunities which complement the self-directed focus of tutorials. Teaching usually takes place up to the fourth week of your final term on the course.</p><p>Although students for the PGDip attend undergraduate lectures and classes, they are full members of the graduate community and are expected to draw on all the graduate resources of the faculty and the university.</p><p>Please note that there is no graduation ceremony for the PGDip.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>Tutorials are typically weekly, but supervisions for longer essay projects will be less frequent.

Depending on the combination of papers you choose, you may write either two short essays, or one long essay in place of one written examination. The subject area of the essays will be approved by the Faculty of Theology and Religion and the tutor teaching the paper. Written examinations for all papers are held in Trinity Term of the final year of study and vary in date each year depending on the papers selected and the schedule of the Examination Schools. Submitted essays are due at the beginning of Trinity Term in the final year of study. </p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Students who earn a graduate qualification with the University of Oxford often progress to further academic study within the Faculty or in other universities.

It involves extensive independent study and the opportunity to undertake and present original research at an advanced level.", "about": "<div class=\"field-item even\"><div id=\"content-tab\"><p>This degree offers access to a wide variety of experienced specialists in many different fields of theology and religion, including the study of the world religions; biblical studies; science and religion; ecclesiastical history; systematic theology; ethics; patristics, and philosophical theology. Recent research topics have included, among many other projects, a study of devotion to the infant Jesus in early Christianity; an exploration of trauma in film and the theology of memory; a study of classical Hinduism and environmentalism. Students develop an extensive range of research skills and expertise in their chosen field of research.</p><p>Students admitted to the DPhil will often have acquired one of the Faculty of Theology and Religion's MSt or MPhil degrees within their area of research, ie theology, religious studies or another closely-related field. Students in possession of a Master's degree from another institution may have this requirement waived. The Faculty of Theology and Religion considers such waivers on a case-by-case basis and may advise applicants to consider an MSt or MPhil degree in their initial application to the University.</p><p>DPhil students become part of an active and vibrant community of graduate research students within the Faculty of Theology and Religion. DPhil students are encouraged to attend and contribute to a wide range of research seminars, workshops and conferences held within the faculty and across the wider Humanities Division. They are also encouraged to attend and participate in the faculty’s professional development sessions, preparatory teaching workshops and graduate teaching training scheme.</p><h3>Part-time study</h3><p>Please note that part-time study requires prior arrangement with a potential supervisor about time spent in Oxford. Part-time students are required to attend for a minimum of thirty days of university-based work each year. Some attendance in term-time is normally required. </p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>All DPhil students are assigned a supervisor or supervisors, who will provide support and guidance to help them develop their ideas, direction and a programme of research. A supervisor is expected normally to meet with a research student for a detailed discussion of the student’s progress at least twice a term during the period of study.  Meetings are likely to take place more frequently during the early stages of a research programme, and to involve reading and commenting upon substantial amounts of written work during the latter stages.</p><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Faculty of Theology and Religion and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Faculty of Theology and Religion. In such circumstances, a second internal supervisor may be appointed.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>DPhil students join the faculty as a Probationary Research Student (PRS) and apply for 'Transfer of Status' usually within their first year (if full-time), or their second year (if part-time). The Transfer of Status process involves the submission of a 5,000 word writing sample, and an interview with two specialist assessors. There is a further assessment of candidates’ work and progress at a more advanced stage of their research, known as 'Confirmation of Status', which requires submission of a 10,000 word extract from the thesis, abstracts, and a further interview with assessors. The degree is awarded on the successful completion of the research dissertation (no more than 100,000 words in length) and an oral examination, commonly called ‘the viva’ (viva voce). The final viva is conducted by an internal and an external examiner with relevant scholarly expertise.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Students with graduate qualifications in theology and religion enter a variety of careers. Many Oxford DPhil students proceed to academic posts in major research universities, liberal arts colleges or church seminaries. Some go on to work for charities and for development, non-profit organisations and think tanks, or in faith-based work. Others proceed to successful professional careers in the civil service, consultancy, the media and academic administration.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

The programme has received the highest level of recognition in UK national and global assessment exercises. It is a community from which you will draw support and guidance but which will also learn from your own contribution to its work.</p><p>You will have rich opportunities for connecting with fellow-students, postdoctoral fellows, and temporary and permanent academic staff involved in disciplinary and cross-disciplinary research programmes. The department attracts many of the world’s leading figures in International Relations (IR) - as visiting scholars, speakers in the regular IR Colloquium, and participants in research conferences and workshops.</p><p>Doctoral students spend the first year of full-time study, or the first two years of part-time study, in the development of, and early work on, the thesis topic; in improving knowledge of quantitative and qualitative research methods; in attendance at relevant lectures, seminars and classes; and in preparing to transfer from Probationary Research Student (PRS - the status at which you will normally be admitted - see Assessment) to full DPhil status.</p><p>An academic supervisor will advise and guide you as you progress through the different stages of your doctoral research. In addition to work for your supervisor, you will be required to take a range of coursework. In the first term this includes: Research Design and Methods (RDM) in IR, Research Design, and introductory or intermediate statistics, as well as attendance at the regular IR DPhil Research Seminar which runs through the year and at which doctoral students present their work. In the second term students continue with RDM in IR and take one course in Formal Analysis, Causal Inference or Qualitative Methods. In the third term, there are a series of short, specialised methods courses. For part-time students, these coursework obligations are distributed across six terms.</p><p>Exemptions from particular elements of the coursework can be sought on the basis of previous training. Subsequent years are largely devoted to the development of the thesis project.</p><p>Doctoral theses will normally require substantial original research, often involving archives, fieldwork, interviewing or other forms of data generation and collection. For the doctoral degree the most crucial requirement is that the thesis makes a ‘significant and substantial contribution to the field of knowledge within which it falls’. There are many ways of achieving this.</p><p>The department is committed to the rigorous use of a plurality of methods. There are many different ways of conducting research for a thesis. Any or all may be valid in a given case, depending on the subject of the research and the questions addressed. Some theses may involve an analytical-descriptive attempt at understanding different events, perspectives and traditions of thought. Others may have a strong historiographical element - exploring, for example, the relation between events and ideas, or involving an original and expert use of sources. Others may involve advancing a hypothesis about a subject and then testing it with a range of qualitative and/or quantitative approaches. Apart from meeting the highest scholarly standards, there is no set template. There is also a strong and successful tradition of normative and critical work. Oxford IR seeks to combine the best of North American political science with deep engagement with the international relations of different parts of the world and with the history of different traditions of thought on the subject.</p><p>As a doctoral student of the department, you will have access to outstanding library and computing resources within the Social Sciences Division (of which the Department of Politics and IR is a major part), elsewhere in the University and, in most cases, in your college. The division runs network events to enable DPhil students to meet and network with their colleagues not only within politics and IR but with other social science disciplines.</p><p>As a part-time student you will be required to attend classes, seminars, supervision meetings and other obligations in Oxford for a minimum of thirty days each year.<br/>There will be limited flexibility in the dates and pattern of attendance. Attendance will be required during term-time at least one day each week throughout the first two years of your study on days determined by your class and seminar attendance and by your supervisor. Attendance will be required outside of term-time on dates to be determined by mutual agreement with your supervisor.<br/>You will be required to attend fieldwork and training sessions on dates to be determined by mutual agreement with your supervisor.</p><p>Successful completion of an Oxford DPhil requires an intense and sustained level of personal motivation and focus within a world-class research and teaching environment.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Department of Politics and International Relations and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Supervisors are usually selected from the <a href=\"https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/people.html?cat=14&amp;lang=en&amp;search=academic_profiles&amp;task=search\">academic staff</a> within the Department of Politics and International Relations. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Department of Politics and International Relations. </p><p>You will be assigned an academic supervisor who will advise and guide you as you progress through the different stages of your doctoral research. </p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>Applicants are admitted to the DPhil with Probationer Research Student (PRS) status. As a PRS, you will develop your research proposal and skills, complete a programme of assessed research methods coursework, and produce a draft section or sections of the thesis, in order to apply for the Transfer of Status that will end your probationary period as a research student. The Graduate Studies Committee will require satisfactory completion of this training programme as a condition of your change of status from PRS to DPhil.</p><p>Once you have been admitted to full DPhil status, you must achieve confirmation of that status by the end of your ninth term as a full-time doctoral student, or by the end of your eighteenth term as a part-time student. Once you have completed your thesis, you will be examined <em>viva voce</em>.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>International Relations has an outstanding placement record. The largest group of DPhil students go on to careers in academia or research. Many move on to post-doctoral fellowships in the UK, continental Europe and North America. Our doctoral students have a distinguished history of winning thesis and other prizes and of publishing their work in leading journals and with major university presses. The universities at which IR graduates have gained academic positions over recent years include: ANU, McGill, Waterloo, Sciences Po, Amsterdam, Groningen, The Graduate Institute Geneva, SAIS/JHU, ETH Zürich, The New School, Swarthmore, LSE, Oxford, Cambridge, King’s College London, University College London, Queen Mary London, St Andrews, Exeter, Reading, Warwick, PUC Santiago, and FGV São Paulo. Oxford IR DPhils also work at all levels in many of world’s leading think-tanks and research institutes in Europe and North America but also in Brazil, South Africa, and Singapore. Others still have moved to achieve leading positions in the policy and political world. The department runs regular courses on professional training, including on interviews, research grant applications and academic publishing.</p><p>DPIR is committed to engaging with its <a href=\"https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/research-centre/alumni/alumni\">alumni community</a>, through its Inspires alumni email newsletter and Alumni Career Conversations series of online talks. </p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

The department also has close connections with other departments and research centres across the University.</p><p>As a DPhil student you will undertake your own original research project under the guidance of your supervisor, whom you will typically meet two to three times a term. The supervisor will help develop and guide your project and, at later stages, provide feedback on chapter drafts. However, you will work to a significant extent on your own, and you will need a high level of motivation and self-discipline.</p><p>During an initial probationary period as a Probationer Research Student (PRS), you will develop and begin work on your thesis topic. You will be offered training in relevant research methods, language, computing and other skills, and you will have the opportunity to attend lectures, seminars and classes in your general topic area. Full-time students are expected to be resident in Oxford for the PRS period.</p><p>As a PRS, you will also take one taught course, either in research methods or from an Oxford master’s degree relevant to your research, which will be examined. Full-time students usually transfer to full DPhil status by the end of their first year and part-time students usually transfer by the end of their second year.</p><p>Following satisfactory progress and transfer to full DPhil status, you may leave Oxford for up to three terms (six terms for part-time students) in order to conduct fieldwork, if the project requires. You will then continue the course by carrying out your own research under the guidance of your supervisor, with whom you will continue to meet or correspond with regularly. Full-time students should return to Oxford after fieldwork for at least three terms.</p><p>Time to completion depends on the complexity of an individual student’s research programme and on the amount of fieldwork that may be required. The University considers that the normal time for completion of the DPhil should be three to four years (four to eight years for part-time), or for students who transfer to the DPhil after the MPhil in Development Studies two to three years (four to six years for part-time), although the exact time will vary depending on the complexity and ambition of the project. In exceptional circumstances there are procedures in place which allow students to apply for extensions of time or to suspend their status for fixed periods of time.</p><h3>Further information about part-time study</h3><p>Applicants wishing to study part-time while in employment will be asked to provide a letter from their employer confirming that they are supportive of the study and are willing to release them from the workplace for study in Oxford, independent study and any fieldwork necessary for data collection. In addition, where appropriate, students will be required to obtain the written agreement from their employer for the use of their employer’s data in their research.</p><p>As a part-time student you will be required to attend classes, seminars, supervision meetings and other obligations in Oxford for a certain number of days each year. In your first year as a probationer student, it is expected that you will need to be resident in Oxford for a minimum of 48 working days in the year in order to participate in induction activities at the start of the academic year and then classes and seminars for your Qualifying Examination. The exact days will depend on the choice of course for the Qualifying Examination and whether the classes take place in Michaelmas or Hilary term.</p><p>After the probationary period, you will be required to be resident for a minimum of 30 days of university-based work each year, normally coinciding with the full terms of the academic year. These days will be arranged with the agreement of your supervisor and will be for the period that your name remains on the Register of Graduate Students unless individually dispensed by the Departmental Graduate Studies Committee.</p><p>There will be limited flexibility in the dates and pattern of attendance, which will be determined by mutual agreement with your supervisor.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Oxford Department of International Development and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. </p><p>In the case of students who require specific help to adjust to an academic programme or to a new range of skills, the supervisor will work with them to ensure that they have additional support.</p><p>The availability of supervision varies year on year and candidates are advised to review the list of eligible supervisors from the department’s webpage for the DPhil course to ensure their areas of interest are compatible.</p><p>Each student/supervisor relationship is different and the number of meetings varies, but generally, students are likely to meet with their supervisor two or three times per term.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>You will be admitted initially as a Probationer Research Student (PRS). At the end of your first year, you will be examined on one taught course (either in research methods or from an Oxford master’s degree relevant to your research). You must pass this course with a strong performance in order to transfer from PRS status to full DPhil status. You also need departmental approval of a fully developed research plan, which you will present in your transfer paper to two assessors approved by the department’s graduate studies committee. Within a maximum of four terms as a full-time PRS student or eight terms as a part-time PRS student, you will be expected to apply for and achieve transfer of status from Probationer Research Student to DPhil status. The department’s preference is for Transfer to be completed by the end of the third term (full-time) or sixth term (part-time) in order for students to commence fieldwork during the Trinity Term summer vacation.</p><p>Assessment of progress will be made during sessions with your supervisor and also in more formal viva voce assessments – for the Transfer of Status and for Confirmation of Status (usually at the end of the third year for full-time students and end of the sixth year for part-time students). More information on these two assessments can be found in the course handbook on the ODID website's course page.</p><p>DPhil students submit their thesis for examination three to four years (or six to eight years for part-time) from the date of admissions and defend their thesis in a viva voce examination which takes place between the student and their two appointed examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><blockquote class=\"cis-hide\" style=\"margin: 0 7% 1.5em 1.5em;\"><p>Through the DPhil, I learned critical thinking skills that have guided me in a variety of contexts.

The programme aims to train first-rate biomedical scientists equipped with the skills needed to transform their research through the creation of innovative, reusable computational tools and solutions for cutting-edge biomedical research problems. </p><p>This four-year programme of research and training has strong industrial links, with each student having both academic and industrial supervision.</p><p>The programme enables students from a range of scientific backgrounds to focus on computational biomedical research problems, including the design and testing of new chemical and biological entities, the modelling of biological and physiological systems, the robust analysis of large complex datasets and the development of novel computational methods for medical and biological imaging. This cross-disciplinary work introduces students to cutting-edge software engineering, machine learning, cheminformatics, computational simulation, bioinformatics, data mining, statistical analysis, physical and structural study of biomolecules, mathematical modelling, and medical and biological imaging. Underpinning the entire programme will be an appreciation of the vital importance of taking a responsible and reproducible approach to computational biomedical research.</p><p class=\"cishide\">The Centre for Doctoral Training's (CDT) industrial partners are currently: A-Alpha Bio, AstraZeneca, CCDC, Diamond, DJS Antibodies, Eli Lilly, Exscientia, Fusion Antibodies, GE Healthcare, GSK, Roche, Immunocore, Lhasa, LifeArc, Lurtis, Merck, Novo Nordisk, OMass, Oxford Drug Design, Procter &amp; Gamble, Twist Bioscience, UCB Pharma, University of Notre Dame, Vernalis, and Vertex Pharma.</p><p>A major advantage of the programme is that you are not required to choose the substantive DPhil project until after the initial taught training phase, allowing a more informed choice of research project to be made.</p><p>In addition to learning about biomedical science, the first term of the course is devoted to acquiring advanced software development and theoretical and technical skills that form the backbone of interdisciplinary research in this area. This training draws from the engineering, mathematical, physical, chemical and biological sciences through a combination of intensive lecture courses, project work and hands-on software development. Each taught module lasts for either one, two or three weeks and is assessed using a method appropriate to the course: for example, open-source software development, presentations, group assignments or written work. This will be complemented with relevant research and communication skills training throughout the four years of the programme. A key element of the programme is the group-development of an open-source software solution to a current research problem put forward by our industrial collaborators.</p><p>After completion of the taught training phase, you will undertake two exploratory research projects of thirteen weeks' duration each, similar in scope to a master's-level project, followed by the just over three-year DPhil project. You will be based within the research group of your principal supervisor for these, which may be in the University or with an industrial partner.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision is the responsibility of the CDT and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. In the first year of the  course, students will be supervised by the programme directors, who will also support students in choosing their doctoral research project. Supervision arrangements for the DPhil will therefore be confirmed at the end of the first year when the doctoral project is chosen.</p><p>Where possible your academic supervisor will not change for the duration of the doctoral research phase of your course (years two to four), however it may be necessary to assign a new academic supervisor for reasons which might include sabbatical leave, maternity leave or change in employment.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>During the first year students are assessed on each of the taught modules undertaken in the first term as well as completing a project report on each of the two short rotation projects undertaken. Satisfactory achievement will be required for progression to the research stage, assessed by a DTC viva on transfer to the appropriate department.</p><p>Assessment during the following three years of the programme will follow the regulations of the department in which you are hosted, and typically involves Transfer of Status and Confirmation of Status as standard. On completion of your thesis you will be examined orally in a DPhil viva.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>The programme is part of the Doctoral Training Centre (DTC) which has a strong record of alumni success. To date, around half of the department's students have gone on to pursue academic careers and have moved into industrial research. The DTC’s alumni are responsible for at least 20 start-up companies and over 30 granted or pending patents. Many students who have gone onto successful careers are invited back to talk to current students within the Research Skills sessions.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

Depending on the combination of papers you choose, you may write either two short essays, or one long essay in place of one written examination. The subject area of the essays will be approved by the Faculty of Theology and Religion and the tutor teaching the paper. Written examinations for all papers are held in Trinity Term of the final year of study and vary in date each year depending on the papers selected and the schedule of the Examination Schools. Submitted essays are due at the beginning of Trinity Term in the final year of study. </p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Students who earn a graduate qualification with the University of Oxford often progress to further academic study within the Faculty or in other universities.

The elective modules offer a tutorial-style teaching and discussion environment in smaller groups. Teaching is delivered by core faculty from the Smith School and School of Geography and the Environment - as well as from other departments across the University - and guest lecturers from enterprise, including some of the Smith School's Business Fellows.</p><p>The course is structured across three terms, following a progression from broad-based concepts and skills to increasing application and engagement.</p><ul><li>Nature and sources of climate emergency and development challenges, including scientific underpinnings and conceptual building blocks aimed at framing and understanding the problems and trade-offs posed by NZSD: Michaelmas term.</li><li>Integrated assessment of potential solutions and pathways, offering applications and solutions: Hilary term.</li><li>Implementation of knowledge and solutions through the enterprise forum and dissertation preparation: Trinity term.</li></ul><h3>Dissertation</h3><p>An independent and original dissertation (15,000 words) is an integral component of the course and enables students to translate their foundational and applied knowledge to a context/challenge related to enterprise and NZSD. Training in qualitative and quantitative methods, data and research design and research skills will help you to develop transferable skills, carry out independent and original research and master methods used widely in academic and professional research.</p><h3>Integrating impact and enterprise</h3><p>The course aims to equip students with knowledge, skills and networks to understand and accelerate NZSD. As such, the theme of achieving impact runs through all course modules, and is integrated in a number of specific ways:</p><ul><li>The enterprise forum will run in parallel with the core modules throughout course. It will form the focal point for engagement with enterprise, and will give students the chance to work with enterprise from the outset and put their learnings into practice, bringing to life the key concepts explored in the core modules. The enterprise forum will include leadership skills development, mentorship, and case-based learning, as well as being an incubator for dissertations. The enterprise forum will also be a standing feature of weekly course meetings, providing a roadmap for the field trips, group projects and dissertation research involving enterprise partners</li><li>Regular guest lectures from enterprise partners will complement the core modules, and enterprise partners will help to identify and possibly participate in dissertation projects</li><li>Weekly business case workshops</li><li>The course will involve practicums with partners in public and private enterprise, such as innovative workshops, hackathons and related activities</li><li>Field trips will explore the role of enterprise in tackling the NZSD challenges. Two one-day trips will take place in each of Michaelmas and Hilary terms. An induction field trip will also take place in Michaelmas term introduction week. In addition, a field trip at the end of Hilary term will be a week-long capstone, where students will visit a selected region to connect individual companies and their supply chains in order to bring to life key concepts and enable students to apply their learning.</li></ul><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The course has an Academic Director and a Course Director who looks after the day to day running of the course. You will have a personal advisor who is a member of the School’s academic staff and who provides academic welfare support.</p><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the School of Geography and the Environment (SoGE) and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the School of Geography and the Environment.</p><p>Dissertation supervision will equate to approximately eight hours in total per student, in line with SoGE guidelines. As such, it is likely that a student will meet with their supervisor at a minimum once a fortnight or most likely once a week. The frequency of supervision meetings will likely change depending on the stage of the dissertation that the student is at and their unique needs. Supervision meetings will commence late in Hilary Term and conclude at the end of Trinity term.</p><p>The Course Director will work closely with each student to try and match their theoretical and contextual interests with an appropriate supervisor. Regarding differences between part-time and full-time versions of the course and according adjustments to supervisor arrangements, this does not apply as the MSc is only offered on a full-time basis. For any students doing the MSc alongside an MBA as part of the 1+1 programme, any necessary adjustments to supervision will be made.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>The core modules are assessed by written examination. The two elective modules are each assessed by an essay. You will also be assessed on your individual dissertation, which will have been  produced independently and contain original work.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>This MSc will equip current and future decision-makers with the knowledge, skills and networks to lead change towards sustainability across the public and private sectors and, on a global stage. The course will enable students to either start or continue on and rapidly progress within a career trajectory, or to pivot and change sector and/or function. The department anticipate that the majority of graduating students will pursue non-academic careers. However, some exceptional students are likely to pursue DPhil studies, and they will receive mentorship to support these ambitions. Destinations of past graduates include top-tier consulting firms, niche sustainability consulting, intergovernmental organisations (eg UN agencies, World Bank), and sustainability managerial roles in various sectors (FMCG; finance).</p><p>Employability is embedded throughout the course in multiple ways:</p><ul><li>By connecting science and enterprise for academic excellence: The MSc in Sustainability, Enterprise and the Environment is at the intersection of research on economics, finance and governance, leveraging interdisciplinary science. The course will be anchored in theoretical and methodological innovations to understand and respond to challenges at an applied level.</li><li>Through direct practitioner knowledge within core teaching staff.</li><li>Focus on outcomes through the enterprise forum and business case seminar series</li></ul><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

It involves extensive independent study and the opportunity to undertake and present original research at an advanced level.", "about": "<div class=\"field-item even\"><div id=\"content-tab\"><p>This degree offers access to a wide variety of experienced specialists in many different fields of theology and religion, including the study of the world religions; biblical studies; science and religion; ecclesiastical history; systematic theology; ethics; patristics, and philosophical theology. Recent research topics have included, among many other projects, a study of devotion to the infant Jesus in early Christianity; an exploration of trauma in film and the theology of memory; a study of classical Hinduism and environmentalism. Students develop an extensive range of research skills and expertise in their chosen field of research.</p><p>Students admitted to the DPhil will often have acquired one of the Faculty of Theology and Religion's MSt or MPhil degrees within their area of research, ie theology, religious studies or another closely-related field. Students in possession of a Master's degree from another institution may have this requirement waived. The Faculty of Theology and Religion considers such waivers on a case-by-case basis and may advise applicants to consider an MSt or MPhil degree in their initial application to the University.</p><p>DPhil students become part of an active and vibrant community of graduate research students within the Faculty of Theology and Religion. DPhil students are encouraged to attend and contribute to a wide range of research seminars, workshops and conferences held within the faculty and across the wider Humanities Division. They are also encouraged to attend and participate in the faculty’s professional development sessions, preparatory teaching workshops and graduate teaching training scheme.</p><h3>Part-time study</h3><p>Please note that part-time study requires prior arrangement with a potential supervisor about time spent in Oxford. Part-time students are required to attend for a minimum of thirty days of university-based work each year. Some attendance in term-time is normally required. </p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>All DPhil students are assigned a supervisor or supervisors, who will provide support and guidance to help them develop their ideas, direction and a programme of research. A supervisor is expected normally to meet with a research student for a detailed discussion of the student’s progress at least twice a term during the period of study.  Meetings are likely to take place more frequently during the early stages of a research programme, and to involve reading and commenting upon substantial amounts of written work during the latter stages.</p><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Faculty of Theology and Religion and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Faculty of Theology and Religion. In such circumstances, a second internal supervisor may be appointed.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>DPhil students join the faculty as a Probationary Research Student (PRS) and apply for 'Transfer of Status' usually within their first year (if full-time), or their second year (if part-time). The Transfer of Status process involves the submission of a 5,000 word writing sample, and an interview with two specialist assessors. There is a further assessment of candidates’ work and progress at a more advanced stage of their research, known as 'Confirmation of Status', which requires submission of a 10,000 word extract from the thesis, abstracts, and a further interview with assessors. The degree is awarded on the successful completion of the research dissertation (no more than 100,000 words in length) and an oral examination, commonly called ‘the viva’ (viva voce). The final viva is conducted by an internal and an external examiner with relevant scholarly expertise.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Students with graduate qualifications in theology and religion enter a variety of careers. Many Oxford DPhil students proceed to academic posts in major research universities, liberal arts colleges or church seminaries. Some go on to work for charities and for development, non-profit organisations and think tanks, or in faith-based work. Others proceed to successful professional careers in the civil service, consultancy, the media and academic administration.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

You may study the early doctrines and practices of religious traditions or opt to study the modern variations of a particular religion, or a set of religious practices or institutions in the contemporary world.</p><p>Students will normally be assigned a tutor (or tutors) for each religion, who will guide them through study over one of each of the first two terms of the academic year (ie you can normally expect to study one religion in each term, though arrangements are subject to tutor availability).</p><p>Each of these traditions has an internationally-recognised research centre, institute or outstanding cluster of scholars in Oxford. This typically means that you are not only taught by specialists in your chosen tradition, but also have access to a variety of specialist libraries and collections.</p><h4>Research seminars</h4><p>In addition there is a fortnightly Inter-disciplinary Graduate Research Seminar on the Study of Religions, on topics directly relevant to the course, which all MSt students are expected to attend. </p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Faculty of Theology and Religion and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Faculty of Theology and Religion.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>You will take an exam on the core course, in the final month of the course duration.</p><p>Your two chosen religions will be examined by two papers, of which one will consist of two essays and one will consist of a dissertation. The choice of essay and dissertation topics will be decided by you, subject to advice from your supervisor and final approval.</p><p>Between them, essays and dissertations must deal with the two chosen religions only. You may devote an equal quantity of assessment to each religion (the two essays in one religion, and the dissertation in another), or may devote more attention to one religion (for instance, the dissertation and one essay in one religion), so long as your two papers clearly demand the study of two religions. Essays and dissertations on the interactions, relations or comparisons between the two religions, or approaches taken from one view towards the other, are also encouraged, with the proviso that there is no overlap between essays and dissertation.</p><p>You will submit your essays at the beginning of Trinity term, which means that they must be researched and written during Michaelmas and Hilary terms, according to a writing schedule worked out with your assigned supervisors. The dissertation is submitted at the end of Trinity term, so you may work on the dissertation throughout the year, and particularly in the third term.</p><p>You will be encouraged to use the work on your essays as building blocks towards your dissertation. </p><p>Additional supervisions are offered in the third term to aid students in the writing of their dissertation, as well as a number of revision classes.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Students who leave the University of Oxford with graduate degrees in theology and religion enter a variety of careers all around the world. Many of those who gain an MSt or MPhil proceed to further, usually doctoral, study. Others secure employment as, for example, civil servants, lawyers, school teachers,  parliamentary research assistants or staff members of, or researchers at, non-governmental organisations that work on issues pertaining to religion in public life.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

You will be expected to develop a topic that contributes to an understanding of law in society, drawing on empirical data, to a greater or lesser degree, and adopting theoretical and analytic perspectives from any social science discipline, or a combination of disciplinary perspectives.</p><p>During the first year you will attend weekly seminars convened by members of staff at the Centre for Socio-Legal Studies (CSLS) on ‘Theory and Methods in Socio-Legal Research’. Part-time students will be able to tailor their study and methods training in liaison with their supervisor, and may attend the seminars over a two-year period. The seminars are intended to develop an appreciation of law as a social phenomenon, to introduce various theoretical perspectives and to consider the variety of practical empirical techniques by which research questions may be addressed.<br/> <br/>Throughout the course, you will be able to take part in an extensive range of seminar programmes and discussion groups, affording plentiful opportunities for interaction both with your peers and with academics working in the same or similar research areas.</p><h4><strong>Part-time attendance details</strong></h4><ol><li>As a part-time student you will be required to attend 18 two-hour seminars in Theory and Methods, each followed by a 90 minute research seminar, in Oxford over the course of two years.

In exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the CSLS.</p><p>Throughout the period of your studies, you will work with a supervisor with whom you will meet individually at regular intervals to discuss your project and who will provide feedback and advice. In the case of students who require specific help to adjust to an academic programme or to acquire a new range of skills, additional support may be made available after consultation with the supervisor.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>All students will be initially admitted to the status of Probationer Research Student (PRS). Within a maximum of four terms as a full-time PRS student (eight terms as a part-time student), you will be expected to apply for, and achieve, transfer of status from Probationer Research Student to DPhil status by taking a qualifying test (QT) which is assessed by two examiners. This requires you to submit a well-developed research outline plus a substantial piece of written work. This application is normally made by the third term for full-time students (sixth term for part-time students). A similar exercise then takes place in your sixth term, or later (twelfth term for the part-time pathway), when you report on your progress and submit a substantial part of the proposed thesis for a further assessment, which leads to a confirmation of DPhil status.</p><p>After three or at most four years (no later than eight years for the part-time pathway), you submit your final thesis to two examiners, respectively internal and external to the University. The examiners will read your thesis and then conduct an oral examination with you, known as a viva voce, before providing a written report to the Law Faculty. On that basis, your thesis may be judged to have passed, so that you can be awarded a DPhil, or to be in need of revision, in which case it is referred back to you for re-submission at a later date; in extreme cases, the thesis may not be passed.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>DPhil students pursue a range of career paths after completion of the doctorate.

The degree and expectations for both modes of study are equally rigorous: part-time students take their classes with the full-time students, but spread over two years to accommodate work and personal circumstances. Whether you choose to apply for the part-time or full-time course, you will be part of a close-knit cohort of students from diverse backgrounds.</p><p>Full-time students will be expected to spend around 40 hours studying each week during term and are additionally expected to complete assignments and undertake further study during vacations. During the first (Michaelmas) and second (Hilary) terms, students are advised to allocate between 10 and 15 hours each week for each course they undertake.</p><p>This includes:</p><ul><li>At least six hours per week on reading, preparation and formative assignments for each core/option course</li><li>10 to 12 hours per week in classes (typically one and a half to two hours of lectures per course, plus a one hour seminar or workshop on certain core and methods-based courses)</li></ul><p>Part-time students will be expected to commit to a proportional workload.

Option modules run for eight weeks in each term.</p><p>Recent option modules have included:</p><h4>Substantive Options</h4><ul><li>Cultural Analytics</li><li>Digital Capitalism and Its Inequalities</li><li>Digital Era Government and Politics</li><li>Digital Technology and Economic Organization</li><li>Education the Internet and Society (run in the Department of Education)</li><li>Internet Economics</li><li>Social Network Analysis and Interpretation</li><li>Law and the Internet</li><li>Subversive Technologies</li></ul><h4>Methods Options</h4><ul><li>Advanced Statistics for Internet Research</li><li>Computational Methods for the Social Sciences</li><li>Digital Interviewing and Qualitative Data Analysis</li><li>Digital Ethnography</li></ul><p>Please note that not all Substantive or Methods options run every year.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Oxford Internet Institute and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Oxford Internet Institute.</p><p>MSc students can expect to meet with their supervisor 8-10 times over the course of the degree. Students are assigned a general supervisor in their first term who will be the point of contact for keeping an eye on their academic progress. In the second term (Hilary term), students are reassigned to a thesis supervisor in order to ensure that student needs and skills are properly matched. Thesis supervisors are responsible for giving written feedback on at least one complete draft of the student’s thesis prior to submission as well as additional advice on research design, data access, and analysis methods.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>MSc Social Science of the Internet course assessment will either be conducted by timed examination or submission.</p><p>Core courses Internet and Society, Internet Technologies and Regulation, and Digital Social Research Methods: Statistics are all assessed by timed examination.</p><p>The core course Digital Social Research Methods: Methods Core is assessed by submission, as are all Substantive Methods and Option courses with the exception of the Methods Option course Advanced Statistics which is assessed by an assignment submission and timed examination.</p><p>In addition to the options you take, you will write a thesis. The thesis is the capstone to the MSc experience. It provides students with the opportunity to apply the methods and approaches they have covered in the other parts of the course and carry out a substantive piece of academic research, including designing a study, carrying out data collection and analysis, and developing a theoretical framework.</p><p>Part-time students will write their dissertations in the third term of their second year, but will be encouraged to start planning their dissertation from their first year.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Employers recognise the value of a degree from the University of Oxford. OII MSc graduates have secured excellent positions in industry, government, NGOs, or have gone on to pursue doctoral studies at top universities. For example, non- academic destinations of recent graduates have included large Internet companies such as Google or Meta; dynamic technology start-up firms like Academia.edu, Spotify, TikTok and Bumble; consultancy and other professional service functions; and positions with regulators or government agencies globally.

Part-time study also provides an excellent opportunity for professionals to undertake rigorous long-term research that may be relevant to their working life.</p><p>As a part-time student you will be required to attend classes/seminars/research groups/supervision meetings and other obligations in Oxford for a minimum of 30 days each year. There will be limited flexibility in the dates and pattern of attendance, which will be determined by mutual agreement with your supervisor.</p><p>For more information, please contact <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6a0b0e07031919030504192a191a03440512440b09441f01\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"d9b8bdb4b0aaaab0b6b7aa99aaa9b0f7b6a1f7b8baf7acb2\">[email protected]</span></a>.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Department of Social Policy and Intervention and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Department of Social Policy and Intervention.</p><p>Typically, students pursuing a DPhil in Social Intervention and Policy Evaluation are supervised by faculty who are affiliated with the department’s Evidence-Based Social Intervention and Policy Evaluation programmes. <a href=\"https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/social-intervention-and-policy-evaluation-doctoral-study\">Information about supervisors</a> can be found on the department's website under the supervisors tab.   </p><p>In the case of students who require specific help to adjust to an academic programme or to a new range of skills, the supervisor will work with them to ensure that they have additional support.</p><p>Students should normally expect to meet with their supervisor around three to four times a term.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>The sequence of milestones for a DPhil student are as follows:</p><ol><li>Admission as a Probationer Research Student (PRS)</li><li>Transfer to DPhil status (‘Transfer of Status’)</li><li>Confirmation of DPhil status for DPhil students (‘Confirmation of Status’)</li><li>Submission of thesis</li></ol><p>All students will be initially admitted to the status of Probationer Research Student (PRS). Within a maximum of four terms as a full-time PRS student or eight as a part-time PRS student, you will be expected to apply for, and achieve, transfer of status from Probationer Research Student to DPhil status. This application is normally made by the third term for full-time students and by the sixth term for part-time students.</p><p>A successful transfer of status from PRS to DPhil status will require the student to show that their proposed thesis and treatment represents a viable topic and that their written work and interview show that they have a good knowledge and understanding of the subject. Students who are successful at transfer will also be expected to apply for and gain confirmation of DPhil status to show that your work continues to be on track. This will need to be achieved within nine terms of admission for full-time students and eighteen terms of admission for part-time students.</p><p>Both milestones normally involve an interview with two assessors (other than your supervisor) and therefore provide important experience for the final oral examination.</p><p>Full-time students will be expected to submit a substantial thesis after three or, at most, four years from the date of admission. If you are studying part-time, you be required to submit your thesis after six or, at most, eight years from the date of admission. To be successfully awarded a DPhil in Social Intervention and Policy Evaluation, you will need to defend your thesis orally (viva voce) in front of two appointed examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Many <a href=\"http://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/alumni-profiles\">graduates of the DPhil</a> go on to pursue academic careers in world-leading research universities, while others hold influential positions in government, non-governmental and international organisations, such as the World Bank, the World Health Organisation and the UN.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

You can typically expect to meet your supervisor at least three times a term.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>All students will be initially admitted to the status of Probationer Research Student (PRS). Within a maximum of four terms as a full-time PRS student or eight terms as a part-time PRS student, you will be expected to apply for, and achieve, transfer of status from Probationer Research Student to DPhil status. This application is normally made in the third term for full-time students and in the sixth term for part-time students.</p><p>Students who are successful at transfer will also be expected to apply for, and achieve, confirmation of DPhil status to show that their work continues to be on track. This should be done within nine terms for full-time students and eighteen terms for part-time students, though this application is normally made in the sixth term for full-time students and in the twelfth term for part-time students.</p><p>Full-time DPhil students are typically expected to submit a thesis after three or, at most, four years from the date of admission. If you are studying part-time, you be required to submit your thesis after six or, at most, eight years from the date of admission. To be successfully awarded a DPhil in Sociology, you must defend your thesis orally (<em>viva voce</em>) in front of two appointed examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Alumni have gone on to academic/research positions at universities in the UK (eg Cambridge, LSE, Manchester, UCL, Bath, Essex, Birmingham and Durham) and across the world (eg UCLA, Yale, Penn, Stanford, EUI Florence, ETH Zurich, Berlin, Stockholm, Hong Kong, Tsinghua) and to research-intensive jobs in government and international organisations (eg OECD), think-tanks, NGOs and the private sector (eg banks and marketing).</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

The DPhil, normally taking three to four years of full-time study to complete, is known as a PhD at other universities.", "about": "<div class=\"field-item even\"><div id=\"content-tab\"><p>The DPhil in Social Data Science at the Oxford Internet Institute (OII) will introduce you to cutting-edge research whilst studying in a beautiful, historic setting that is both student- and family-friendly. During your study at Oxford, you are encouraged to pioneer new approaches to contemporary social and policy issues online, developing new computational and data-driven methodology to inform the development and governance of technology. As a student, you will be part of a diverse cohort of research students, of many nationalities and from a wide range of scientific backgrounds. Research students in Social Data Science are graduates in subjects from computer science and mathematics to physics, as well as transdisciplinary subjects such as human-centred data science and complex systems.</p><p>The course combines individual supervision with a selection of lectures, seminars, transferrable skills training, and opportunities to participate in leading-edge research activities. OII faculty are world class experts working in the cutting-edge of their fields, and this innovative research is fully reflected in their course teaching. You will be able to audit courses led by faculty at the OII, as well as courses in other departments.</p><p>The programme provides a strong computational foundation, training you to develop new research skills in areas such as machine learning, statistical modelling, large-scale data collection, algorithm auditing, or network science. The DPhil in Social Data Science provides you with a rare grounding in both technical skills and social science research , helping you build critical skills to study digital technologies. There are weekly opportunities for you to interact with <a href=\"//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/dphil-information-communication-and-social-sciences\">DPhil in Information, Communication and the Social Sciences</a> students, providing a rich multidisciplinary environment.</p><p>As a full-time student, you are expected to continue working outside of the University terms with an annual holiday of approximately eight weeks.</p><h3>Part-time study</h3><p>The DPhil programme at the OII is also available on a part-time basis. The part-time programme is spread over six to eight years of study and research. It offers the flexibility of part-time study with the same high standards and requirements as the full-time DPhil programme. The part-time DPhil also provides an excellent opportunity for professionals in industry and civil society to undertake rigorous long-term research that may be relevant to their career.</p><p>As a part-time student, you will be required to attend seminars, supervision meetings, and other obligations in Oxford for a minimum of 30 days each year. Attendance will be required during term-time (a minimum of one day each week). There will be limited flexibility in the dates and pattern of attendance, which will normally be determined by the fixed teaching and seminar schedule during term. Attendance may be required outside of term-time on dates to be determined by mutual agreement with your supervisor. You will have the opportunity to tailor your part-time study in liaison with your supervisor and agree your pattern of attendance.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Oxford Internet Institute and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff.</p><p>Supervision for the DPhil in Social Data Science spans multiple departments (please see the <a href=\"https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/study/dphil-in-social-data-science/?supervisors\">full list of faculty members</a> eligible to supervise DPhil students for this programme). A supervisor may be found outside the list on the course web page, and co-supervision is also possible. All students will have at least one supervisor who is a faculty member of the OII.</p><p>Students should normally expect to meet with their supervisor at least three to four times a term. A more typical pattern is weekly or bimonthly, at least until you reach the stage of writing up your thesis.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>The first year is a probationary year, soon after which, subject to satisfactory progress, you will be expected to transfer from Probationer Research Student (PRS) status to full DPhil status. The Transfer of Status takes place within a maximum of four terms for full-time students or eight terms for part-time students. A second formal assessment of progress, Confirmation of Status, takes place later in the programme, normally at the end of the third year. The Transfer of Status and Confirmation of Status assessments are conducted by two members of staff other than the student’s supervisor(s) or advisors.</p><p>The sequence of milestones for a DPhil student are as follows:</p><ol><li>Admission as a Probationer Research Student (PRS)</li><li>Transfer to DPhil status (‘Transfer of Status’)</li><li>Confirmation of DPhil status for DPhil students (‘Confirmation of Status’)</li><li>Submission of thesis</li></ol><p>Students initially admitted to the status of Probationer Research Student (PRS) are required to attend and pass core modules from the OII’s training programme. Students who have already completed similar courses in their past academic career should request an exemption from one or more modules by providing sufficient evidence.  </p><p>A successful transfer of status from PRS to DPhil status will require the student to show that their proposed thesis represents a viable topic and that their written work and interview show that they have a good knowledge and understanding of the subject. Students are also required to demonstrate satisfactory completion of the foundational courses by this point.</p><p>Following successful transfer, students will need to apply for and gain confirmation of DPhil status to show that the work continues to be on track. This will need to be completed within nine terms of admission for full-time students and 18 terms of admission for part-time students.</p><p>Both milestones involve an interview with two assessors (other than your supervisor) and therefore provide important experience for the final oral examination.</p><p>Full-time students will be expected to submit an original thesis of not more than 100,000 words three or, at most, four years from the date of admission. If you are studying part-time, you be required to submit your thesis after six or, at most, eight years from the date of admission. To be successfully awarded a DPhil in Social Data Science you will need to defend your thesis orally (viva voce) in front of two appointed examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>The Oxford Internet Institute provides you with skills and opportunities in teaching, research, policymaking and business innovation. Employers recognise the value of a degree from the University of Oxford, and the OII’s doctoral students regularly go on to secure excellent positions in industry, government, and NGOs. </p><p>Alumni who have pursued academic careers have taken up research and teaching positions including notably at the University of Oxford, Cornell University, University of Hong Kong, Imperial College London, and TU Delft. OII DPhil alumni have worked in a wide range of organisations including The World Bank, Open Technology Fund, Oxfam, Cisco, McKinsey, and Google.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/study/alumni-stories/\">OII Alumni page</a> features interviews from both MSc and DPhil alumni about their time at the Department and career paths after Oxford.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

Part-time students will be able to tailor their study and methods training in liaison with their supervisor, and may attend the seminars over a two-year period. The seminars are intended to develop an appreciation of law as a social phenomenon, to introduce various theoretical perspectives and to consider the variety of practical empirical techniques by which research questions may be addressed.<br/> <br/>Throughout the course, you will be able to take part in an extensive range of seminar programmes and discussion groups, affording plentiful opportunities for interaction both with your peers and with academics working in the same or similar research areas.</p><h4><strong>Part-time attendance details</strong></h4><ol><li>As a part-time student you will be required to attend 18 two-hour seminars in Theory and Methods, each followed by a 90 minute research seminar, in Oxford over the course of two years.

This requires you to submit a well-developed research outline plus a substantial piece of written work. This application is normally made by the third term for full-time students (sixth term for part-time students). A similar exercise then takes place in your sixth term, or later (twelfth term for the part-time pathway), when you report on your progress and submit a substantial part of the proposed thesis for a further assessment, which leads to a confirmation of DPhil status.</p><p>After three or at most four years (no later than eight years for the part-time pathway), you submit your final thesis to two examiners, respectively internal and external to the University. The examiners will read your thesis and then conduct an oral examination with you, known as a viva voce, before providing a written report to the Law Faculty. On that basis, your thesis may be judged to have passed, so that you can be awarded a DPhil, or to be in need of revision, in which case it is referred back to you for re-submission at a later date; in extreme cases, the thesis may not be passed.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>DPhil students pursue a range of career paths after completion of the doctorate.

The degree and expectations for both modes of study are equally rigorous: part-time students take their classes with the full-time students, but spread over two years to accommodate work and personal circumstances. Whether you choose to apply for the part-time or full-time course, you will be part of a close-knit cohort of students from diverse backgrounds.</p><p>Full-time students will be expected to spend around 40 hours studying each week during term and are additionally expected to complete assignments and undertake further study during vacations. During the first (Michaelmas) and second (Hilary) terms, students are advised to allocate between 10 and 15 hours each week for each course they undertake.</p><p>This includes:</p><ul><li>At least six hours per week on reading, preparation and formative assignments for each core/option course</li><li>10 to 12 hours per week in classes (typically one and a half to two hours of lectures per course, plus a one hour seminar or workshop on certain core and methods-based courses)</li></ul><p>Part-time students will be expected to commit to a proportional workload. The course content for the part-time degree is identical to that taken by full-time students but will be completed in two years rather than one year. Part-time students will be expected to attend lectures, seminars and workshops in the department for one to two days a week during term-time, and to participate fully in the life of this friendly and dynamic department.</p><p>During Trinity term, you will attend weekly seminars where you will present and develop your thesis research and receive feedback from fellow students and academic staff.</p><h3>Core Courses</h3><p>Core courses run weekly during the first term: Digital Social Research Methods: Methods Core; Digital Social Research Methods: Statistics Core; Internet and Society; Internet Technologies and Regulation.</p><h4>Internet and Society</h4><p>An overview of the major findings to date regarding the social implications of the Internet, drawing material from several social science disciplines, including communication studies, sociology, and political science.</p><p>Part-time students take this course in their first year of study.</p><h4>Internet Technologies and Regulation</h4><p>Exploring the interplay between social and technological shaping of the Internet, and associated policy implications.

Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Oxford Internet Institute.</p><p>MSc students can expect to meet with their supervisor 8-10 times over the course of the degree. Students are assigned a general supervisor in their first term who will be the point of contact for keeping an eye on their academic progress. In the second term (Hilary term), students are reassigned to a thesis supervisor in order to ensure that student needs and skills are properly matched. Thesis supervisors are responsible for giving written feedback on at least one complete draft of the student’s thesis prior to submission as well as additional advice on research design, data access, and analysis methods.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>MSc Social Science of the Internet course assessment will either be conducted by timed examination or submission.</p><p>Core courses Internet and Society, Internet Technologies and Regulation, and Digital Social Research Methods: Statistics are all assessed by timed examination.</p><p>The core course Digital Social Research Methods: Methods Core is assessed by submission, as are all Substantive Methods and Option courses with the exception of the Methods Option course Advanced Statistics which is assessed by an assignment submission and timed examination.</p><p>In addition to the options you take, you will write a thesis. The thesis is the capstone to the MSc experience. It provides students with the opportunity to apply the methods and approaches they have covered in the other parts of the course and carry out a substantive piece of academic research, including designing a study, carrying out data collection and analysis, and developing a theoretical framework.</p><p>Part-time students will write their dissertations in the third term of their second year, but will be encouraged to start planning their dissertation from their first year.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Employers recognise the value of a degree from the University of Oxford. OII MSc graduates have secured excellent positions in industry, government, NGOs, or have gone on to pursue doctoral studies at top universities. For example, non- academic destinations of recent graduates have included large Internet companies such as Google or Meta; dynamic technology start-up firms like Academia.edu, Spotify, TikTok and Bumble; consultancy and other professional service functions; and positions with regulators or government agencies globally.

Each member of academic staff has expertise in a particular area of social intervention and policy evaluation and you should try to <a href=\"https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/academic-teaching-staff\">contact your potential supervisor</a> prior to applying as you will only be accepted for a DPhil if there is an appropriate supervisor available. </p><p>As a doctoral student you will be offered a unique graduate programme tailored to your individual needs. In addition to individual supervision, the department offers a large and diverse range of research groups, seminars, workshops and advanced training opportunities in order to further enhance graduate research experience.</p><h3>Part-time course arrangements</h3><p>The DPhil programme in Social Intervention and Policy Evaluation is also available on a part-time basis. The part-time version of the degree has the same high standards and requirements as the full-time degree, but spread over six-eight years. The degree is particularly well-suited for students who are seeking the flexibility of part-time study. Part-time study also provides an excellent opportunity for professionals to undertake rigorous long-term research that may be relevant to their working life.</p><p>As a part-time student you will be required to attend classes/seminars/research groups/supervision meetings and other obligations in Oxford for a minimum of 30 days each year. There will be limited flexibility in the dates and pattern of attendance, which will be determined by mutual agreement with your supervisor.</p><p>For more information, please contact <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0a6b6e67637979636564794a797a63246572246b69247f61\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"d2b3b6bfbba1a1bbbdbca192a1a2bbfcbdaafcb3b1fca7b9\">[email protected]</span></a>.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Department of Social Policy and Intervention and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Department of Social Policy and Intervention.</p><p>Typically, students pursuing a DPhil in Social Intervention and Policy Evaluation are supervised by faculty who are affiliated with the department’s Evidence-Based Social Intervention and Policy Evaluation programmes. <a href=\"https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/social-intervention-and-policy-evaluation-doctoral-study\">Information about supervisors</a> can be found on the department's website under the supervisors tab.   </p><p>In the case of students who require specific help to adjust to an academic programme or to a new range of skills, the supervisor will work with them to ensure that they have additional support.</p><p>Students should normally expect to meet with their supervisor around three to four times a term.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>The sequence of milestones for a DPhil student are as follows:</p><ol><li>Admission as a Probationer Research Student (PRS)</li><li>Transfer to DPhil status (‘Transfer of Status’)</li><li>Confirmation of DPhil status for DPhil students (‘Confirmation of Status’)</li><li>Submission of thesis</li></ol><p>All students will be initially admitted to the status of Probationer Research Student (PRS). Within a maximum of four terms as a full-time PRS student or eight as a part-time PRS student, you will be expected to apply for, and achieve, transfer of status from Probationer Research Student to DPhil status. This application is normally made by the third term for full-time students and by the sixth term for part-time students.</p><p>A successful transfer of status from PRS to DPhil status will require the student to show that their proposed thesis and treatment represents a viable topic and that their written work and interview show that they have a good knowledge and understanding of the subject. Students who are successful at transfer will also be expected to apply for and gain confirmation of DPhil status to show that your work continues to be on track. This will need to be achieved within nine terms of admission for full-time students and eighteen terms of admission for part-time students.</p><p>Both milestones normally involve an interview with two assessors (other than your supervisor) and therefore provide important experience for the final oral examination.</p><p>Full-time students will be expected to submit a substantial thesis after three or, at most, four years from the date of admission. If you are studying part-time, you be required to submit your thesis after six or, at most, eight years from the date of admission. To be successfully awarded a DPhil in Social Intervention and Policy Evaluation, you will need to defend your thesis orally (viva voce) in front of two appointed examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Many <a href=\"http://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/alumni-profiles\">graduates of the DPhil</a> go on to pursue academic careers in world-leading research universities, while others hold influential positions in government, non-governmental and international organisations, such as the World Bank, the World Health Organisation and the UN.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

A second formal assessment of progress, Confirmation of Status, takes place later in the programme, normally at the end of the third year. The Transfer of Status and Confirmation of Status assessments are conducted by two members of staff other than the student’s supervisor(s) or advisors.</p><p>The sequence of milestones for a DPhil student are as follows:</p><ol><li>Admission as a Probationer Research Student (PRS)</li><li>Transfer to DPhil status (‘Transfer of Status’)</li><li>Confirmation of DPhil status for DPhil students (‘Confirmation of Status’)</li><li>Submission of thesis</li></ol><p>Students initially admitted to the status of Probationer Research Student (PRS) are required to attend and pass core modules from the OII’s training programme. Students who have already completed similar courses in their past academic career should request an exemption from one or more modules by providing sufficient evidence.  </p><p>A successful transfer of status from PRS to DPhil status will require the student to show that their proposed thesis represents a viable topic and that their written work and interview show that they have a good knowledge and understanding of the subject. Students are also required to demonstrate satisfactory completion of the foundational courses by this point.</p><p>Following successful transfer, students will need to apply for and gain confirmation of DPhil status to show that the work continues to be on track. This will need to be completed within nine terms of admission for full-time students and 18 terms of admission for part-time students.</p><p>Both milestones involve an interview with two assessors (other than your supervisor) and therefore provide important experience for the final oral examination.</p><p>Full-time students will be expected to submit an original thesis of not more than 100,000 words three or, at most, four years from the date of admission. If you are studying part-time, you be required to submit your thesis after six or, at most, eight years from the date of admission. To be successfully awarded a DPhil in Social Data Science you will need to defend your thesis orally (viva voce) in front of two appointed examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>The Oxford Internet Institute provides you with skills and opportunities in teaching, research, policymaking and business innovation. Employers recognise the value of a degree from the University of Oxford, and the OII’s doctoral students regularly go on to secure excellent positions in industry, government, and NGOs. </p><p>Alumni who have pursued academic careers have taken up research and teaching positions including notably at the University of Oxford, Cornell University, University of Hong Kong, Imperial College London, and TU Delft.

Part-time students are required to spend a minimum of 30 days on study-related business in Oxford each year and to commit approximately 20 hours per week to their studies. Part-time students are also expected to be in Oxford for the first few weeks of the first term so that they can fully participate in induction activities which are held at the beginning of Michaelmas term (October). Part time DPhils are expected to be active members of the Blavatnik School of Government Research Community even when not in Oxford. </p><p>The DPhil specialises in discipline-based, policy-driven research, applying rigorous social science to analysing policy issues with the explicit goal of prescribing solutions for policymakers. You will concentrate on research that answers policy questions with rigorous conceptual design, theoretical insight, and empirical methods. As well as honing your research skills and developing your interdisciplinary understanding of policy challenges, you will also enhance your ability to communicate your research findings to the policy community in a way that ensures real-world impact. You will join a school which conducts groundbreaking academic research where international leaders will engage with you and your scholarly community on the most pressing issues of our time.</p><p>The DPhil in Public Policy is one of Oxford's most selective degree courses and recruits those who are highly academically and professionally capable. Your peer group will include economists, lawyers, political scientists, behavioural scientists, and philosophers with professional backgrounds at international organisations such as the World Bank and the World Economic Forum and senior levels of government.</p><p>You will be expected to focus your research on practical challenges facing a range of different governments and publicly-oriented agencies. As well as developing your academic expertise, you will learn how to communicate your findings and analysis effectively so as to have real impact on government and public policy development throughout the world.</p><p>You will benefit from the DPhil Research Development seminar series and will be given ample opportunities to present your work in the department, and develop your research ideas and proposals with the advice and support of your peers.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Blavatnik School of Government and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming students to work with a particular member of staff.</p><p>Your supervisors are carefully selected and will include a member of core member of faculty, together with other academics from the school or the University. You will usually have two supervisors during your DPhil research.</p><p>Your primary supervisor will establish a timetable of regular meetings for detailed discussion of your work and progress, normally a minimum of nine one-hour meetings (or equivalent) each year, although the frequency of meetings will vary depending on your stage of research.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>In your first year, you will be admitted to Probationer Research Student (PRS) status in the first instance. As a PRS, you will focus on the development and early work of your thesis.</p><p>Within a maximum of four terms as a full-time PRS student or eight as a part-time PRS student, you will be expected to apply for, and achieve, transfer of status from Probationer Research Student to DPhil status. This application is normally made by the third term for full-time students and by the sixth term for part-time students by submitting a research outline and a substantial piece of written work. These are assessed by two academics (at least one of whom will usually be a Blavatnik School faculty member), who will also interview you about your work. A similar exercise then takes place in your ninth term (fourteenth term if you are part-time) when you will apply for confirmation of DPhil status.</p><p>After three or at most four years (no later than eight years if you are part-time) you are expected to submit your final thesis. Your thesis will be read by two examiners who conduct an in-depth oral examination with the student, known as a viva voce. On the basis of their report, you will either be awarded the DPhil (which may be subject to major or minor corrections) or referred back to make revisions to the thesis.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Graduates of the DPhil in Public Policy will be professional social scientists working in the area of public policy. You will be prepared to lead on devising, implementing, and evaluating innovative policy solutions; and you will be expertly qualified to conduct research, whether as an academic, in a governmental role, or in other influential policy organisations, institutes, and think tanks.</p><p>The school’s alumni form a close-knit community providing social connections, professional guidance and a trusted source of advice. These connections also serve as powerful reminders for all of us of our shared commitment to public service and our desire to make a positive difference in the world. For more information, visit our <a href=\"https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/alumni\">Alumni pages</a>.</p><p>At the Blavatnik School of Government you will develop the skills required to succeed in your career as well as benefit from a programme of career-focused events. Collaborating with your fellow students and faculty will help you discover career paths and opportunities in public service and academia. The Blavatnik School of Government also offers an outstanding programme of speaker events at which many visitors discuss their careers, and outside of the school there are many events organised by departments, centres, societies and colleges – all of these provide opportunities to meet with global specialists and develop your network of contacts.</p><p>In addition, students can receive expert one-to-one careers advice at the University's Careers Service, which is very close to the Blavatnik School, and attend careers fairs, talks, workshops and employer presentations.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

Part-time students are required to spend a minimum of 30 days on study-related business in Oxford each year and to commit approximately 20 hours per week to their studies. Part-time students are also expected to be in Oxford for the first few weeks of the first term so that they can fully participate in induction activities which are held at the beginning of Michaelmas term (October). Part time DPhils are expected to be active members of the Blavatnik School of Government Research Community even when not in Oxford. </p><p>The DPhil specialises in discipline-based, policy-driven research, applying rigorous social science to analysing policy issues with the explicit goal of prescribing solutions for policymakers. You will concentrate on research that answers policy questions with rigorous conceptual design, theoretical insight, and empirical methods. As well as honing your research skills and developing your interdisciplinary understanding of policy challenges, you will also enhance your ability to communicate your research findings to the policy community in a way that ensures real-world impact. You will join a school which conducts groundbreaking academic research where international leaders will engage with you and your scholarly community on the most pressing issues of our time.</p><p>The DPhil in Public Policy is one of Oxford's most selective degree courses and recruits those who are highly academically and professionally capable. Your peer group will include economists, lawyers, political scientists, behavioural scientists, and philosophers with professional backgrounds at international organisations such as the World Bank and the World Economic Forum and senior levels of government.</p><p>You will be expected to focus your research on practical challenges facing a range of different governments and publicly-oriented agencies. As well as developing your academic expertise, you will learn how to communicate your findings and analysis effectively so as to have real impact on government and public policy development throughout the world.</p><p>You will benefit from the DPhil Research Development seminar series and will be given ample opportunities to present your work in the department, and develop your research ideas and proposals with the advice and support of your peers.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Blavatnik School of Government and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming students to work with a particular member of staff.</p><p>Your supervisors are carefully selected and will include a member of core member of faculty, together with other academics from the school or the University. You will usually have two supervisors during your DPhil research.</p><p>Your primary supervisor will establish a timetable of regular meetings for detailed discussion of your work and progress, normally a minimum of nine one-hour meetings (or equivalent) each year, although the frequency of meetings will vary depending on your stage of research.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>In your first year, you will be admitted to Probationer Research Student (PRS) status in the first instance. As a PRS, you will focus on the development and early work of your thesis.</p><p>Within a maximum of four terms as a full-time PRS student or eight as a part-time PRS student, you will be expected to apply for, and achieve, transfer of status from Probationer Research Student to DPhil status. This application is normally made by the third term for full-time students and by the sixth term for part-time students by submitting a research outline and a substantial piece of written work. These are assessed by two academics (at least one of whom will usually be a Blavatnik School faculty member), who will also interview you about your work. A similar exercise then takes place in your ninth term (fourteenth term if you are part-time) when you will apply for confirmation of DPhil status.</p><p>After three or at most four years (no later than eight years if you are part-time) you are expected to submit your final thesis. Your thesis will be read by two examiners who conduct an in-depth oral examination with the student, known as a viva voce. On the basis of their report, you will either be awarded the DPhil (which may be subject to major or minor corrections) or referred back to make revisions to the thesis.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Graduates of the DPhil in Public Policy will be professional social scientists working in the area of public policy. You will be prepared to lead on devising, implementing, and evaluating innovative policy solutions; and you will be expertly qualified to conduct research, whether as an academic, in a governmental role, or in other influential policy organisations, institutes, and think tanks.</p><p>The school’s alumni form a close-knit community providing social connections, professional guidance and a trusted source of advice. These connections also serve as powerful reminders for all of us of our shared commitment to public service and our desire to make a positive difference in the world. For more information, visit our <a href=\"https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/alumni\">Alumni pages</a>.</p><p>At the Blavatnik School of Government you will develop the skills required to succeed in your career as well as benefit from a programme of career-focused events. Collaborating with your fellow students and faculty will help you discover career paths and opportunities in public service and academia. The Blavatnik School of Government also offers an outstanding programme of speaker events at which many visitors discuss their careers, and outside of the school there are many events organised by departments, centres, societies and colleges – all of these provide opportunities to meet with global specialists and develop your network of contacts.</p><p>In addition, students can receive expert one-to-one careers advice at the University's Careers Service, which is very close to the Blavatnik School, and attend careers fairs, talks, workshops and employer presentations.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

Research projects that students have worked on include ‘Can routinely collected data be used to accurately and completely follow-up participants in large randomised trials?’ and ‘Biological Ageing: Statistical analysis of physical and biochemical biomarkers in UK Biobank’. A typical day of a DPhil student varies through the course but will include literature reviews, data analysis, discussion with the research group and writing-up the research thesis.</p><p>Your supervisors will be the main source of your research training; you will also be encouraged to strengthen your research skills by taking relevant training courses. Research training will be within a multidisciplinary research environment which includes epidemiology, statistics, ethics, health economics, health promotion, health services research, and big data.</p><p>You will be encouraged to make use of the range of skills training offered by the Medical Sciences Division and the department throughout your study at the Nuffield Department of Population Health (NDPH). All students will be asked to complete a Training Needs Analysis (TNA) in the first term of your studies, which will be used to help students to assess their skill level and identify training required. There is no set period of time that should be used for training – students will be able to pursue the training they need. This training includes statistics, epidemiology, data management, research ethics, writing academic papers and presentation skills. You are also expected to identify additional relevant external courses that will support your research training.</p><h3>Further information about part-time study</h3><p>A small number of part-time students may be admitted to the DPhil in Population Health. Candidates applying for admission to this part-time course are required to show that their DPhil research topic is suited to part-time study and the supervisors agree with the part-time schedule. The in-residence attendance requirement will be a minimum of 30 days University-based work per year. This will be spread across the academic year with a minimum of ten days based in the department each term. However, attendance is likely to be higher and will be determined by the demands of the individual DPhil research project.</p><p>As a part-time student you will be required to attend supervision meetings and other obligations in Oxford for a minimum of 30 days each year. There will be limited flexibility in the dates of attendance, which will be determined by mutual agreement with your supervisor. You will have the opportunity to tailor your part-time study in liaison with your supervisor and agree your pattern of attendance.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Nuffield Department of Population Health and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. In some circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Nuffield Department of Population Health. Each student will be supervised by at least two supervisors. If one supervisor is from outside the department, a second supervisor will be appointed from within the department.</p><p>A supervisor should meet with their student regularly across the year. Once every two weeks during term time is indicative but is subject to individual arrangements.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>All students will be admitted to the status of Probationer Research Student (PRS). Within a maximum of four terms as a full-time PRS student or eight terms as a part-time PRS student, you will be expected to apply for transfer of status from PRS to DPhil status.</p><p>Students who are successful at transfer will also be expected to apply for and gain confirmation of DPhil status to show that their work continues to be on track. This will need to be done within nine terms of admission for full-time students and eighteen terms of admission for part-time students.</p><p>Both milestones require an oral assessment with two assessors and therefore provide important experience for the final oral examination.</p><p>You will be expected to submit an original thesis after three years for full-time students and six years for part-time students. To be successfully awarded a DPhil in Population Health, your will need to defend your thesis orally (viva voce) in front of two appointed examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Most DPhil alumni progress to academic posts both in the UK and Overseas, while others join health-related professions working for notable organisations such as the WHO and Public Health England.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

Students who are successful at transfer will also be expected to apply for and gain confirmation of DPhil status to show that your work continues to be on track. This will need to be done within nine terms of admission for full-time students and eighteen terms of admission for part-time students.</p><p>Both milestones normally involve an interview with two assessors (other than your supervisor) and therefore provide important experience for the final oral examination.</p><p>Full-time students will be expected to submit a substantial, original thesis after three or, at most, four years from the date of admission. If you are studying part-time, you be required to submit your thesis after six or, at most, eight years from the date of admission. To be successfully awarded a DPhil in Primary Health Care you will need to defend your thesis orally (viva voce) in front of two appointed examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Many of the department's graduates have developed flourishing careers as researchers in the department. Other alumni from the DPhil have gone on to research careers; lectureships or leadership positions in academic departments around the world, including primary care, public health and as methodologists in a range of other departments.

Candidates without such a background who wish to pursue the philosophy of physics for graduate study are encouraged instead to apply for the BPhil. This course is not available in part-time mode of study and is not offered via distance learning. Please note that this course is not a research degree.</p><h3>Course structure</h3><p>This course consists of two core subjects (Philosophy of Physics, and Philosophy of Science) and one elective subject. Tuition is offered in the form of supervisions, lectures and classes. In a typical fortnight during term, a student can expect to spend around two hours receiving one-to-one supervision, around four to eight hours attending lectures, around four to eight hours attending graduate seminars, and around four hours attending the Faculty's dedicated Philosophy of Physics invited speaker series. This translates as around 20–30% of a full-time working week. Students should expect to spend the remaining time on self-directed study.</p><h4>Philosophy of physics</h4><p>During the first two terms, you will attend the undergraduate lecture course in Intermediate Philosophy of Physics, participate in a dedicated graduate class in Advanced Philosophy of Physics, and will receive supervisions with (an) expert(s) in the field. </p><h4>Philosophy of science</h4><p>You will attend the undergraduate lecture courses and the graduate class in philosophy of science and receive supervisions. </p><h4>Elective subject</h4><p>You will study one of the following subjects:</p><ul><li>Metaphysics and Theory of Knowledge</li><li>Philosophy of Mind and Action</li><li>Philosophical Logic and Philosophy of Language</li><li>Philosophy of Mathematics</li></ul><p>You will attend the graduate class in the elective subject and receive supervisions. </p><h3>Course outcomes</h3><p>In completing the course, it is expected that you will have:</p><ul><li>pursued a course requiring a high standard in each of the three examined elements, ie philosophy of physics, philosophy of science and an elective subject;</li><li>studied these subjects through supervisions with an expert supervisor and via classes convened by an expert or experts in the relevant field;</li><li>been examined on your chosen areas by a requirement to write four essays;</li><li>had many opportunities to hear and participate in philosophy and philosophy of physics, by attending an annual Graduate Philosophy Conference, talks by invited speakers, philosophy societies and discussion groups, and especially by attending the philosophy of physics research seminars and graduate philosophy of physics discussion classes; and</li><li>been a member of a college graduate community, associating with graduates from many countries, cultures, and academic disciplines.</li></ul><p>The course has no fieldwork, industrial placement or year abroad element, but you may decide to attend conferences, workshops or research training elsewhere.</p><p>You may also attend any undergraduate and graduate classes, seminars and lectures in and outside of the Faculty of Philosophy which are of interest to you, provided those classes, seminars and lectures are open to you.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Faculty of Philosophy, and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Faculty of Philosophy.</p><p>Students normally meet three times with their supervisor in the first term, twice with one supervisor and three times with another supervisor in the second term, and three times with their supervisor in the third term. Supervisions are usually around two hours long, on a subject to be chosen by you in consultation with your supervisor, normally on an issue arising out of classes and lectures. You will write an essay for each supervision, and discussion of this essay will form the basis of the supervision.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>You are examined on the basis of four essays.</p><p>The core course in philosophy of physics is examined by two essays on topics that will be prescribed by the examiners. At most one essay may fall under each of the following subjects:</p><ul><li>the philosophy of quantum theory</li><li>the philosophy of space, time and symmetry</li><li>the philosophy of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics</li><li>other topics in the philosophy of physics (previous topics have included black hole thermodynamics and the black hole information paradox).</li></ul><p>The philosophy of science course is examined by one essay on a topic of your own choosing, but excluding topics specifically in the philosophy of physics (as specified above).</p><p>Finally, the elective subject is examined by one essay on a topic of your own choosing within the chosen elective subject.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>MSt in Philosophy of Physics graduates usually progress to the second year of Oxford's <a href=\"//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/bphil-philosophy\">BPhil in Philosophy</a> or to doctoral programmes, either at the faculty itself or elsewhere.

Research projects that students have worked on include ‘Can routinely collected data be used to accurately and completely follow-up participants in large randomised trials?’ and ‘Biological Ageing: Statistical analysis of physical and biochemical biomarkers in UK Biobank’. A typical day of a DPhil student varies through the course but will include literature reviews, data analysis, discussion with the research group and writing-up the research thesis.</p><p>Your supervisors will be the main source of your research training; you will also be encouraged to strengthen your research skills by taking relevant training courses. Research training will be within a multidisciplinary research environment which includes epidemiology, statistics, ethics, health economics, health promotion, health services research, and big data.</p><p>You will be encouraged to make use of the range of skills training offered by the Medical Sciences Division and the department throughout your study at the Nuffield Department of Population Health (NDPH). All students will be asked to complete a Training Needs Analysis (TNA) in the first term of your studies, which will be used to help students to assess their skill level and identify training required. There is no set period of time that should be used for training – students will be able to pursue the training they need. This training includes statistics, epidemiology, data management, research ethics, writing academic papers and presentation skills. You are also expected to identify additional relevant external courses that will support your research training.</p><h3>Further information about part-time study</h3><p>A small number of part-time students may be admitted to the DPhil in Population Health. Candidates applying for admission to this part-time course are required to show that their DPhil research topic is suited to part-time study and the supervisors agree with the part-time schedule. The in-residence attendance requirement will be a minimum of 30 days University-based work per year. This will be spread across the academic year with a minimum of ten days based in the department each term. However, attendance is likely to be higher and will be determined by the demands of the individual DPhil research project.</p><p>As a part-time student you will be required to attend supervision meetings and other obligations in Oxford for a minimum of 30 days each year. There will be limited flexibility in the dates of attendance, which will be determined by mutual agreement with your supervisor. You will have the opportunity to tailor your part-time study in liaison with your supervisor and agree your pattern of attendance.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Nuffield Department of Population Health and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. In some circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Nuffield Department of Population Health. Each student will be supervised by at least two supervisors. If one supervisor is from outside the department, a second supervisor will be appointed from within the department.</p><p>A supervisor should meet with their student regularly across the year. Once every two weeks during term time is indicative but is subject to individual arrangements.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>All students will be admitted to the status of Probationer Research Student (PRS). Within a maximum of four terms as a full-time PRS student or eight terms as a part-time PRS student, you will be expected to apply for transfer of status from PRS to DPhil status.</p><p>Students who are successful at transfer will also be expected to apply for and gain confirmation of DPhil status to show that their work continues to be on track. This will need to be done within nine terms of admission for full-time students and eighteen terms of admission for part-time students.</p><p>Both milestones require an oral assessment with two assessors and therefore provide important experience for the final oral examination.</p><p>You will be expected to submit an original thesis after three years for full-time students and six years for part-time students. To be successfully awarded a DPhil in Population Health, your will need to defend your thesis orally (viva voce) in front of two appointed examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Most DPhil alumni progress to academic posts both in the UK and Overseas, while others join health-related professions working for notable organisations such as the WHO and Public Health England.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

It is regarded both as training for doctoral study and a basis for teaching a range of philosophical subjects. This course is not available in part-time mode of study and is not offered via distance learning.</p><p>The main purpose of the BPhil is to provide future doctoral students with:</p><ul><li>a basis of knowledge and understanding of a number of philosophy subjects that they can develop into areas of teaching competence;</li><li>the skills to conduct independent research in philosophy in their chosen area; and</li><li>the ability to produce written work that displays sustained argument, independent thought and lucid structure and presentation.</li></ul><p>Tuition on the BPhil is through a combination of classes, one-to-one supervisions and independent research.</p><p>The Pro-Seminar introduces incoming BPhil students to graduate study by covering important papers in various areas of philosophy.</p><p>You will also be required to attend graduate classes during the first four terms of study.

These are not separate courses, but a way of maximising the study of these topics within the existing BPhil structure. A student on these tracks would study primarily ancient philosophy or the philosophy of physics/science during the first four terms and go on to write a 30,000-word thesis on an ancient philosophy or philosophy of physics/science topic in the final two terms.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>During the first four terms of study you should receive sixteen hours of one-to-one supervision. Prior to each supervision, you will agree a topic in consultation with your supervisor and write an essay that will be discussed with your supervisor in the supervision. In the last two terms of study, you will research and write a 30,000-word thesis, under the guidance of a supervisor with relevant subject expertise. </p><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Faculty of Philosophy, and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. However, incoming students’ supervision preferences are accommodated where possible. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Faculty of Philosophy.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>BPhil examination is by submission of a thesis and six assessed essays across a range of philosophical subjects. The thesis will be on a topic of your choice, approved by the Graduate Studies Committee.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>BPhil in Philosophy graduates often progress to doctoral programmes, either at the University of Oxford or elsewhere. At the time of publication, BPhil students who progress to the DPhil in Philosophy programme at the University of Oxford have the advantage of skipping the first year of the DPhil as a Probationary Research Student and being allowed, though not obliged, to incorporate the contents of their entire 30,000-word BPhil thesis into their 75,000-word DPhil thesis. Such students also have only another six terms (instead of the usual nine terms) of <a href=\"//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/fees-and-funding/fees-and-other-charges/fee-liability\">fee liability</a> for their DPhil.

Each year, the Faculty of Philosophy welcomes students from a range of courses who have already completed substantial graduate work in philosophy. Typically, students who are successfully admitted to the DPhil course have already completed study that is equivalent or nearly equivalent to that required for Oxford’s <a href=\"//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/bphil-philosophy\">BPhil in Philosophy</a> course. The faculty’s Graduate Studies Committee recommends progression from Oxford's BPhil in Philosophy to the DPhil course, considering the BPhil offers the opportunity to study a wide range of philosophical topics over two years as well as to focus on a narrower field of research interest (unlike most one-year masters in a specialised subject, as offered elsewhere).</p><p>Students may also progress from the faculty's specialised MSt programmes - the <a href=\"//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/mst-philosophy-physics\">MSt in Philosophy of Physics</a>, the <a href=\"//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/mst-ancient-philosophy\">MSt in Ancient Philosophy</a> and the <a href=\"//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/mst-practical-ethics\">MSt in Practical Ethics</a>.</p><p>As part of your doctoral research you will produce a substantial 75,000-word thesis. Students proceeding to the DPhil programme via the BPhil will normally write a DPhil thesis which is an expansion of their BPhil thesis and may be able to incorporate the full contents of their 30,000-word BPhil thesis into the 75,000-word DPhil thesis. However, this is not a formal requirement; sometimes the BPhil thesis topic is not suitable for expansion into a DPhil thesis, or you may wish to write your DPhil thesis on a different topic.</p><p>You are not required to attend any taught graduate classes as part of your DPhil degree, but you are encouraged to participate in lectures, classes, seminars and other educational opportunities offered throughout the university as relevant to your topic of study. The course has no fieldwork, industrial placement or year abroad element, but you may decide to attend conferences, workshops or research training elsewhere.</p><p>You may attend any graduate or undergraduate classes, seminars and lectures in and outside of the Faculty of Philosophy which are of interest to you, provided that those classes, seminars and lectures are open to you.</p><p>Each term, many graduate classes and research seminars are organised by faculty members in which graduate students are full and important participants.</p><p>Graduates are encouraged to organise their own seminars and reading groups, and they also run two societies: one invites distinguished speakers from the UK and around the world, while the other gives graduates the opportunity to present papers to a graduate audience.</p><p>Each year there is an Oxford Graduate Philosophy Conference, in which most graduate philosophy students participate in some way.</p><p>The <strong>Masters of Letters (MLitt)</strong> in Philosophy is awarded on the basis of a thesis of maximum 50,000 words. In practice, applicants are admitted for the MLitt only in exceptional cases, and few students submit a thesis for the MLitt. The MLitt is more often an exit award for DPhil students who fail or withdraw from the DPhil degree but meet the requirements for the MLitt.</p><h3>Course Outcomes</h3><p>As a DPhil student, you will research, summarise, present and defend an argument with some of the best scholars in their subject, under the direction of (an) experienced researcher(s), and will extend your skills and experiences.</p><p>During the DPhil you will learn new or hone existing intellectual, practical and transferable skills, as follows:</p><ul><li>analyse and clarify an abstract question, grasp and critically compare different approaches to answering it, and develop an approach of your own</li><li>put complex arguments together for and against a position and take them apart</li><li>interpret difficult historical texts produced within a historical context</li><li>construct extensive pieces of writing that provide a clear overview of a subject and a sustained independent argument about it, presented in a lucid, objective and scholarly manner</li><li>demonstrate excellent oral presentation</li><li>have effective time organisation (since you must produce extensive pieces of written work at regular intervals and to tight deadlines)</li><li>sustain intensive work to a deadline over an extended period</li><li>make effective use of libraries, information technology and other sources of information</li></ul><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Faculty of Philosophy and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Faculty of Philosophy.</p><p>You should have regular one-to-one tuition sessions with your supervisor(s). These will normally happen twice per term but in some terms, especially at the start of the degree and during the final stages of the thesis, the number of sessions may be increased.</p><p>You will normally be assigned one supervisor to start with but towards the end of your course, after you have been awarded confirmation of status, it is usual for you to receive a second, additional supervisor, to offer another view on your work as well as to provide another reference for you if required.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>You will initially be enrolled as a Probationary Research Student (PRS), unless you have previously completed the BPhil course at Oxford (see below). Normally in the third term after enrolment onto the DPhil as a PRS student, you are required to complete a transfer of status from PRS to full DPhil student status. Two appointed examiners will interview you on:</p><ul><li>your thesis outline, which explains the intended line of argument or contribution to the subject;</li><li>a piece of written work in the area and philosophical style of the proposed thesis which is typically, though not necessarily, a draft chapter of the thesis.</li></ul><p>If you progressed from the MSt in Philosophy of Physics course, you are required to write a 20,000-word thesis during your year as a PRS, as your MSt does not have a thesis element.</p><p>Normally at the end of the second year after you enrolled, you will be required to apply for confirmation of your DPhil student status. This application will involve an interview by one or two appointed examiners on:</p><ul><li>your thesis outline, comprising both a reasoned statement of the nature of, and some detail on, the proposed thesis together with a provisional table of contents; and</li><li>a piece of written work intended as a part of the thesis, in final or near-final draft.</li></ul><p>If you progress from the BPhil, you will normally enter the DPhil without being required to pass a year as a PRS and as a result you will normally apply for confirmation of DPhil status in the third term after enrolment onto the DPhil and, according to the Examination Regulations at time of publication, you will only have six terms (instead of the usual nine terms) of <a href=\"//www.ox.ac.uk/students/fees-funding/fees/liability\">fee liability</a> for your DPhil.</p><p>The doctoral work culminates in a 75,000-word thesis that is defended orally in front of two appointed examiners (<em>viva voce</em>).</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>The DPhil in Philosophy's primary aim is to prepare students for an academic career in philosophy. Most DPhil graduates do indeed secure academic posts, as witnessed by the faculty's <a href=\"http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/dphil-placement-record\">placement record</a>.</p><p>The faculty provides a <a href=\"https://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/placement-scheme\">placement scheme</a> to help students seeking jobs within philosophy. Users of the placement scheme may ask their referees to send reference letters directly to the faculty where they will be held on file and sent out to universities or other academic institutions at the student’s request. The placement scheme is normally available to alumni until they have secured a tenured post.</p><p>The faculty's Placement Officer helps job applicants with the preparation of their CVs, provides advice about the presentation of material in an application dossier, and arranges practice interviews. The Placement Officer also holds a yearly introductory placement seminar, compulsory to those wishing to make use of the placement scheme. Also, students are invited to give talks based on material they propose to use in their writing samples or job talks, with an opportunity for comment and discussion. </p><p>The faculty also runs an email mailing list for members of the placement scheme, which will be used to pass on job tips and news of vacancies.</p><p>The faculty runs a teaching scheme, lecturing scheme and a Graduate Teaching Register with the aim of providing teaching experience for those DPhil students who intend to pursue an academic career. In the case of the teaching scheme and Graduate Teaching Register, you will do a certain amount of teaching and marking under the guidance of a college fellow. If you are accepted into the lecturing scheme, you will be allowed to give an undergraduate lecture course of your own choice and design, consisting of four one-hour lectures.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

Diagnosis of TB is complex, especially in young children, because their symptoms are non-specific, they cannot expectorate sputum and often have paucibacillary disease. Despite significant advances in TB diagnostics made in the last decade, they barely impacted on paediatric TB. As a result, under-diagnosis of those with TB is common. Improving paediatric TB diagnosis is very important, not only for individual patients, but also for the assessment of the true burden of paediatric TB and the development of new treatments and vaccines which is hindered by the lack of a reliable reference standard.</p><p class=\"more-less\">New approaches for diagnosis of paediatric TB are urgently needed, especially in three areas that the group is working on:</p><ol class=\"more-less\"><li>tests that can be used at the point of care level;</li><li>non-sputum-based tests; and</li><li>tests that can accurately identify the children with TB currently classified as microbiologically negative.</li></ol><p class=\"more-less\">The group works together in a strong consortium of world-leading scientists and collaborators from around the world, including Uganda, Peru, the United States of America, Switzerland and Canada: the <a href=\"https://www.fend-tb.org\">Feasibility of Novel Diagnostics for TB in Endemic Countries (FEND for TB) Consortium</a>, funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health for five years. The previous NIH-funded consortium led to the development of the GeneXpert Assay. The objective of the FEND for TB Consortium is to support the evaluation of early-stage tuberculosis diagnostic assays and strategies in the context of existing clinical algorithms in tuberculosis endemic countries. FEND for TB conducts early-stage diagnostic accuracy and feasibility studies and then feeds back to assay developers to facilitate the efficiency of the iterative assay evaluation-assay revision process. The consortium also involves a group of highly-recognised experts in modelling to evaluate impact, cost-effectiveness and other key factors to consider for the possible implementation of promising novel TB tests.</p><p class=\"more-less\">This project would offer a variety of exciting opportunities, including in-country study implementation and supervision, biostatistical and analytical work, modelling research, and through close collaboration with the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) insight and contributions to the process of working with the WHO in their regulatory approval process of new diagnostic tests for TB. For further information, please see the <a href=\"https://grantome.com/grant/NIH/U01-AI152084-01\">grant information for FEND for FB</a> and the <a href=\"https://grantome.com/grant/NIH/R01-AI152159-01\">grant information for Novel and Optimized Diagnostics for Pediatric TB</a> (both external links). </p><h3 class=\"more-less\">Daniela Ferreira</h3><p class=\"more-less\">Despite available vaccines, pneumonia is still a major killer affecting particularly vulnerable populations, such as children and the elderly. Pneumococcal infections are most common in the winter with secondary pneumococcal pneumonia being the major cause of mortality following seasonal and pandemic influenza infection. Our group uses Human Infection Challenge models in which participants are deliberately infected with live respiratory viruses and bacteria to study host-pathogen interactions, immune responses, pathogen transmission and to accelerate development of vaccines. Our group offers exciting DPhil projects in the following areas:</p><ul class=\"more-less\"><li>Host and pathogen gene expression associate with pneumococcal shedding</li><li>Systemic and mucosal correlates of protection to respiratory infection and vaccination</li><li>Susceptibility to respiratory disease: chronic inflammation, comorbidities and immuneaging</li><li>Interaction of viral and bacterial co-infections and immune response modulation</li><li>Use of nanoparticle platforms to develop treatments for virus and bacterial respiratory infections</li><li>Computational biology and machine learning</li></ul><p class=\"more-less\">Each project can be tailored to give the student exposure to their methods of interest including B and T cell ELISPOTs, ELISAs, Luminex, multicolour flow cytometry and cell sorting, transcriptomic analysis at population and single cell level, and extensive data analysis (including R) and computational biology (machine learning).</p><h3 class=\"more-less\">Philip Goulder</h3><p class=\"more-less\">It is becoming increasingly clear that immune sex differences have a substantial impact on outcome from infectious disease and vaccines. The group's own studies of children who became infected with HIV in utero show that these immune sex differences start before birth and have substantial impact before birth. Female fetuses born to mothers who themselves become infected with HIV during pregnancy are 2-3x more susceptible to infection than male fetuses. The reason, the group believes, is that the female fetus shares with her mother a strong dependence on the innate immune response, and specifically type I interferon (IFN-I) production in response to viruses such as HIV, to protect against infection. Thus, the virus that evades this defence in the mother is highly IFN-I-resistant, and this same highly IFN-I-resistant virus evades the same innate response in the female fetus, but not male fetuses, who are more susceptible to IFN-I-sensitive viruses with high replicative capacity (Adland et al Nature Communications, 2020).</p><p class=\"more-less\">The Goulder Group Research theme focuses on two related goals: the first being to define the mechanisms and impact of immune sex differences in early life; and the second being to define the immune responses in early life that maximise the potential for achieve cure in HIV-infected children. HIV provides an ideal tool to help understand the immune sex differences that are present in early life and their impact. A cohort of 250 HIV-infected mother child pairs in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, followed from the infant’s birth, form the focus of much of this work in the Peter Medawar Building in Oxford. The exposure of sex-discordant twins to other infections (CMV) and to vaccines provide an additional unique means of evaluating early-life immune sex differences. This group’s work is focused on the South African HIV epidemic. Although the group is based in Oxford, they have over the past 20 years developed strong collaborations in Durban and Kimberley, South Africa.</p><h3 class=\"more-less\">Caroline Hartley</h3><p class=\"more-less\">One in 13 babies are born prematurely; understanding and mitigating the long-term impact of premature birth is important to improve the lives of these children. Apnoea - the cessation of breathing - is a common pathology associated with prematurity. These potentially life-threatening events can result in reduced cerebral oxygenation and frequent apnoeas have been associated with long-term effects including reduced childhood cognitive ability. The focus of the research group is to understand the interaction between apnoea and brain development in premature infants, and to investigate how physiology is altered by pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. The group is part of a multidisciplinary team of clinicians, nurses, mathematicians, engineers and scientists. The group's work focuses on the collection and use of EEG (electroencephalography) and vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate etc) data, and the group develops signal processing techniques and uses machine learning to derive tools with the aim to ultimately improve outcomes for prematurely-born children.</p><p class=\"more-less\">Caroline develops approaches to analyse infant brain activity and physiological data, such as heart rate and oxygen saturation, to address clinically relevant questions in the field of neonatal neuroscience.

These potentially life-threatening events can result in reduced cerebral oxygenation and frequent episodes of apnoea have been associated with long-term effects including reduced childhood cognitive ability. 1 in every 10 babies are born prematurely; understanding and mitigating the long-term impact of premature birth is important to improve the lives of these children.</p><h3 class=\"more-less\">Georg Hollander</h3><p class=\"more-less\">The thymus is the anatomical site where T cells are generated and instructed to provide protective immunity against pathogens whilst ignoring the individual’s own tissues. Thymic epithelial cells (TEC), an essential component of the organ’s 3-dimensional scaffold, attract T cell precursor from the peripheral blood, foster their differentiation in a bespoke micro-environment, and help to select developing T cells based on their antigen specificities. Based on their distinct structural, phenotypic, and transcriptomic features, TEC are differentiated into distinct subtypes. Defects in TEC differentiation and function are incompatible with a normal generation of naive T cells and therefore frequently associated with severe combined immunodeficiencies or a loss of immunological tolerance. The research of the laboratory seeks to detail the genetic and epigenetic control of TEC development and function combining multi-parameter flow cytometry, advanced histological and molecular methods, proteomics, mathematical modelling and transcriptomic analyses at both population level and single cell resolution.</p><h3 class=\"more-less\">Young Chan Kim</h3><p class=\"more-less\">Under the directorship of Professor Sir Andrew Pollard, my team within the Oxford Vaccine Group (OVG) is dedicated to developing novel vaccines against emerging infectious diseases, including, but not limited to, alphaviruses, plague, Coxiella, and Chagas. To achieve our objectives, we utilise a diverse range of vaccine platforms: from viral vectors (such as ChAdOx1 and MVA), mRNA, subunit, VLP and glycoconjugate to design, develop and perform pre-clinical and clinical testing of vaccines with the primary goal of enhancing human health.</p><p class=\"more-less\">We are delighted to offer an exciting opportunity for aspiring researchers eager to contribute to and expand upon our current and innovative vaccine development initiatives as part of a DPhil programme. Throughout their journey, DPhil students will develop specialised skills in vaccine design, pre-clinical/clinical testing of novel vaccines, and the functional assays such as virus neutralisation assay (PRNT) and Serum Bactericidal Assay (SBA). Additionally, a significant emphasis of our team lies in developing new diagnostic tools against emerging infectious diseases and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) suited for low-resource settings, ultimately aiming to improve clinical management and disease surveillance. We are well-equipped to mentor and guide a diverse array of DPhil projects, encompassing both the development of new vaccines and diagnostic assays.</p><h3 class=\"more-less\">Teresa Lambe</h3><h4 class=\"more-less\">Emerging and Outbreak pathogens</h4><p class=\"more-less\">Despite therapeutic advances, the continued emergence and re-emergence of novel infectious pathogens can have devastating healthcare impacts. Increased global interdependence and the ease of human, animal and trade movements facilitate transmission and present multiple opportunities for pathogen spread.</p><p class=\"more-less\">There are a number of novel and dangerous pathogens with recognised pandemic potential, including but not limited to, SARS-CoV-2, Ebola, Marburg, Lassa Fever, Nipah, and Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever. My team is currently focusing on the development and testing of the Oxford/AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222) vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 working closely with Oxford Vaccine Group and global teams.</p><p class=\"more-less\">It is widely recognised that the health of humans and animals are interdependent and a number of emerging infectious diseases have a robust animal reservoir. The group are therefore delineating protective immune responses following natural infection in both human and animals to inform therapeutic development and vaccine design.</p><p class=\"more-less\">Using this information, the group are developing vaccines for a number of emerging pathogens with careful consideration of implications for veterinary cross-over and working closely with collaborators at the Pirbright Institute and NIH. Some of the works are at the pre-clinical stage while others have progressed to clinical trials.</p><p class=\"more-less\">This DPhil represents an exciting opportunity to build on the current and innovative program of vaccine development for emerging and outbreak pathogens while working in close collaboration with the Wellcome Trust major overseas research programme in Kilifi, Kenya and other key players for vaccine development against Emerging Pathogens.</p><p class=\"more-less\">Both specialised subject training and generic research capabilities will be developed, including but not limited to:</p><ul class=\"more-less\"><li>Vaccine design (Molecular cloning &amp; vaccine generation)</li><li>Immunogenicity assessment of human samples</li><li>Cellular immune assays (ELISpot, FACS &amp; Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS))</li><li>Humoral immune assays (ELISA, FACS &amp; Cultured ELISpot)</li><li>Development of translational assays (Pseudotyped virus assay)</li></ul><p class=\"more-less\">All students will be expected to analyse, interpret and present their data internally and at appropriate conferences. This project will provide a broad range of transferable skills with a unique insight into translational research.</p><h3 class=\"more-less\">Martin Maiden</h3><h4 class=\"more-less\">The application of the evolutionary and population approaches to the genomic analysis of bacterial pathogens for translation into public health interventions, especially immunisation</h4><p class=\"more-less\">Specific organism interests include the pathogenic Neisseria and Campylobacter. Highly interdisciplinary work across the Medical and MPLS Divisions.</p><p class=\"more-less\">See, for example: MacLennan JM, Rodrigues CMC, Bratcher HB, Lekshmi A, Finn A, Oliver J, et al. <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30842-2\">Meningococcal carriage in periods of high and low invasive meningococcal disease incidence in the UK: comparison of UKMenCar1-4 cross-sectional survey results</a> (Reference: Lancet Infect Dis. 2021;21:677-87.

However, infection remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality globally, causing ~9% of deaths and two of the five leading causes of disability-adjusted life-years. Acute febrile illness is one of the most common presenting symptoms in healthcare facilities. Signs and symptoms of infection can be non-specific of aetiology. Moreover, diagnostic tests can lack sensitivity and take several hours to days to return conclusive results. Consequently, there is a clinical demand for a new accurate and rapid diagnostic tool — to improve patient care and help tackle the emerging global crisis of antimicrobial resistance.</p><p class=\"more-less\">The immunological processes involved in protective immune responses are not entirely understood and vaccine development has been largely empirical. Recent technological advances offer the opportunity to reveal the immunology underlying vaccine response at an unprecedented resolution. These data could revolutionize the way vaccines are developed and tested and further augment their role in securing global health.</p><p class=\"more-less\">This theme of work explores multi-omics data across a spectrum of immune perturbation — vaccination through to infection. Research includes elucidating the genetic determinants of vaccine responses, describing novel immune correlates of protection, and developing rapid and accurate diagnostics.</p><h3 class=\"more-less\">Andrew Pollard</h3><h4 class=\"more-less\">Oxford Vaccine Group</h4><p class=\"more-less\">At the Oxford vaccine group our mission is the design, development, clinical evaluation and laboratory testing of vaccines to improve human health. We aim to achieve our mission with major programmes on:</p><ul class=\"more-less\"><li>Pneumococcal infection and vaccines (Daniela Ferreira);</li><li>Viral outbreak pathogens (Teresa Lambe);</li><li>Typhoid, paratyphoid, Coxiella, meningococcus and plague (Andrew Pollard);</li><li>Non-typhoidal salmonella (Maheshi Ramasamy);</li><li>TB (Rinn Song);</li><li>Use of “omics” to interrogate vaccine responses (O’Connor);</li><li>Social sciences of vaccines (Samantha Vanderslott); and</li><li>Alphaviruses and Chagas (Young Chan Kim).</li></ul><p class=\"more-less\">Further details can be found under names of individual investigators. These major programmes above are in addition to a broad programme of work on COVID19 and the use of human challenge models and other experimental medicine studies. Our work includes opportunities for PhD training for potential students from both clinical and scientific backgrounds.</p><h3 class=\"more-less\">Katrina Pollock</h3><p class=\"more-less\">Vaccines that provide long-term protection against evolving pathogens eg SARS-CoV-2 and that overcome immunocompromise in older people, are urgently needed. Our knowledge of human immunity is incomplete however, and the opportunity for rational vaccine design has been overlooked. <br/> <br/>To address this, the Lymph node single cell genomics ancestry and ageing (LEGACY) Network studies the key tissue in which the immune response is generated. Using real time ultrasound imaging to sample lymph nodes by fine needle aspiration, coupled with innovative clinical study design, we can map the steady state and vaccine-stimulated immune response over time.</p><p class=\"more-less\">Our work involves detailed immunological techniques such as single cell gene expression, Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-Seq), T cell receptor sequencing, sequencing of immunoglobulin genes, multiparameter flow cytometry and systems serology.</p><p class=\"more-less\">Our experimental medicine model is being used to investigate questions in vaccine-responsive lymph nodes and blood in diverse groups:</p><ol class=\"more-less\"><li>LEGACY01: what is the distribution of immune cell types in unstimulated and responding lymph nodes after seasonal influenza vaccine in an ancestrally diverse cohort?</li><li>LEGACY02: how does age affect the priming and recall responses to a novel adenoviral vector vaccine against Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever?</li><li>LEGACY03: how does age affect the kinetics of the response to seasonal influenza and COVID-19 booster vaccinations?</li></ol><p class=\"more-less\">Our multidisciplinary clinical and scientific research team welcomes applications from DPhil students across the arc of our work, with immunology as the cross-cutting theme.</p><h3 class=\"more-less\">Maheshi Ramasamy</h3><h4 class=\"more-less\">Enteric infections and mucosal immune responses</h4><p class=\"more-less\">Infections caused by Gram negative bacteria are a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in low and middle income countries. Disease control ultimately requires access to good sanitation, but the current lack of sensitive diagnostic tests and increasing resistance to commonly used antibiotics make vaccines against these pathogens a cost-effective medium-term solution.<br/>This theme investigates immunity against enteric pathogens with a focus on non-typhoidal Salmonella disease. Projects can range from assessing vaccines in healthy volunteer clinical trials to developing laboratory techniques to measure systemic and mucosal immune responses.</p><h3 class=\"more-less\">Carlo Rinaldi</h3><p class=\"more-less\">The overall purpose of the group's research is to reduce the global burden of hereditary neurological disease. This goal is pursued through three strategic aims:</p><ol class=\"more-less\"><li>identification of genes associated with neurological diseases,</li><li>advancement of the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis in these diseases, and</li><li>development of effective treatments for hereditary neurological diseases.</li></ol><p class=\"more-less\">This work has recently led to the development of an innovative gene therapy approach for a genetic condition named spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, relying on viral delivery of an isoform of the disease gene Androgen Receptor and suitable for translation into the clinic (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abi6896\">see reference: doi.org 10.1126/sciadv.abi6896</a>) and the identification of genetic variants in the ATP6V0A1 gene as a cause of severe neurodevelopmental conditions (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.01.21257500\">see reference: doi.org 10.1101/2021.06.01.21257500</a>).</p><p class=\"more-less\">In particular, the group are interested in understanding the mechanisms underlying the diversification of the human transcriptomic (RNA editing), the ways those contribute to the functioning of the motor unit in health and disease, and how this knowledge can be harvested to enable targeted correction of mutations in coding sequences of RNA for treatment.</p><p class=\"more-less\">The group employs a combination of transcriptomic analyses, advanced microscopy, cellular and biochemical studies in human iPSC-derived neurons, disease models in mice, and translational studies in human subjects. The group's expectation is that these studies will ultimately reveal central disease mechanisms of neuromuscular diseases and serve as a foundation for the development of effective disease-modifying therapies.</p><h3 class=\"more-less\">Thomas Roberts</h3><h4 class=\"more-less\">RNA medicine</h4><p class=\"more-less\">Strategies for therapeutic manipulation of gene expression have matured to the point where there are now multiple FDA-approved drugs with diverse mechanisms of action including gene silencing (via RNase H-active gapmer oligonucleotides or RNA interference using siRNA) and direct antagonism of proteins (using aptamers), and exon skipping/inclusion using steric block oligonucleotides. Of particular interest are splice switching oligonucleotides that can rescue expression of proteins associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) – both paediatric muscle-wasting disorders which previously had very limited treatment options. Central to the development of these therapies is an understanding of disease nucleic acid biology (in terms of understanding the target mRNA splicing) and drug nucleic acid chemistry (the design, composition, and delivery of the therapeutic molecule). These exciting developments are paving the way for a plethora of new molecule medicines across a wide spectrum of disease indications. The group are interested in developing new modalities of therapeutic gene manipulation, including gene editing, RNA editing, and gene activation. Primarily, the group are focused on neuromuscular diseases (such as DMD and SMA) and infantile epileptic encephalopathies (such as Dravet syndrome).</p><p class=\"more-less\">Work in the group encompasses:</p><ol class=\"more-less\"><li>investigations of novel RNA-targeting or RNA-based therapeutic strategies;</li><li>gene expression profiling to better understand disease (especially in terms of spatial-restriction, sub-cellular localisation, and non-coding RNA); and</li><li>the development of biomarkers for monitoring responses to therapeutic intervention (with a particular focus on small RNA biomarkers).</li></ol><h3 class=\"more-less\">Anindita Roy</h3><p class=\"more-less\">The developmental stage-specific cellular and molecular characteristics of fetal and postnatal progenitors are likely to determine the biology of ALL at different ages. We are particularly interested in high-risk childhood ALL, such as infant ALL and Down syndrome associated ALL. We have recently developed a novel MLL-AF4+ infant ALL model using primary human haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. The overarching aim of research in our lab is to improve the outcomes of children with high-risk ALL.</p><p class=\"more-less\">The current DPhil projects are in these areas:</p><ol class=\"more-less\"><li>Developing faithful models of high-risk childhood ALL to better understand leukaemia initiation and maintenance at different ages;</li><li>Mechanistic studies to understand key drivers of childhood ALL;</li><li>Target discovery and translation of findings from (1) and (2) into preclinical studies; and</li><li>Projects using multi-omics to understand how cell intrinsic and/or microenvironmental characteristics of the developmental stage at which a leukaemia originates, drives the biology of leukaemia at different ages.</li></ol><h3 class=\"more-less\">Stephan Sanders</h3><p class=\"more-less\">Severe neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) lead to serious and often life-threatening symptoms including seizures, cognitive impairment, communication problems, and motor dysfunction. Our group aims to use bioinformatics to identify the genetic mechanisms underlying these disorders and to develop therapies to improve the lives of those affected.</p><p class=\"more-less\">We focus on three main research questions:</p><ol class=\"more-less\"><li>How can we find the genetic variants and genes underlying these disorders in the coding and noncoding genome?</li><li>What do these genetic variants and genes tell us about the underlying neurobiology?</li><li>How can we use these insights to develop advanced therapies to help affected individuals?</li></ol><p class=\"more-less\">Over the past decade, our group has used whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing of thousands of individuals to identify hundreds of genes underlying NDDs (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35982160/\">Read more about this</a> on the PubMed website) and to understand the role of splicing variants and noncoding variants in these disorders (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30661751/\">Read more about this</a> on the PubMed website).</p><p class=\"more-less\">Working with collaborators in the USA (UC San Francisco and Yale) we have generated single-cell datasets with epigenetic (ATAC-seq) and transcriptomic (RNA-seq) data from postmortem brain samples of hundreds of individuals. We use these data to understand regulatory processes underlying brain development and NDDs, including the role of biological sex as a modifier. We also aim to use these data to identify genes and variants that are amenable to genome-targeted therapies, including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and CRISPR-based genome editing.</p><h3 class=\"more-less\">Laurent Servais</h3><h4 class=\"more-less\">STRONG (Specialised Translational Research Oxford Neuromuscular Group)</h4><p class=\"more-less\">STRONG (Specialised Translational Research Oxford Neuromuscular Group) has a special interest for newborns screening of genetic condition, Angelman syndrome, innovative outcomes using magneto-inertial technology and wearable devices and natural history studies.

The unit aims to produce theoretical and empirical research in social sciences and create a bridge to public health issues through policy advice, interventions, and public engagement. We draw on a variety of disciplines from sociology, history, behavioural science, health economics, and public policy to combine a wide set of tools and literatures. Further, being based within the Oxford Vaccine Group, benefits from the unique opportunity to interact with vaccinologists, epidemiologists, immunologists, and clinicians. A particular focus lies on studying actors’ attitudes and behaviour towards vaccination in society, policy, and media, across time and geographies. More broadly, our interests are also in a wide range of public health topics, including issue prioritisation, disease history, and social mobilisation. Our research unit runs regular research seminars, has ongoing collaborative writing groups on a wide range of topics, and frequently hosts visiting researchers, providing a lively environment for DPhil candidates. We can support a range of DPhil projects on the social aspects of vaccination and health, including co-supervision with other groups within the Department of Paediatrics (and in exceptional cases outside of the department).</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Department of Paediatrics and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff.

Where appropriate, a co-supervisor may be found outside the Department of Economics.</p><p>You will be assigned a member of the economics department to act as your academic supervisor to provide advice and support for your academic studies in the first year of the MPhil. In the second year, your MPhil thesis supervisor will act as your academic advisor. Where appropriate, a co-supervisor may be found outside the Department of Economics.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>The three compulsory courses in microeconomics, macroeconomics and econometrics are examined before the start of the third term of the first year. The required thesis is an important component of the second year, and is supervised by a member of the department. The thesis is usually expected to contain some original research. It can be incorporated into a DPhil thesis, if you continue onto the doctoral programme.</p><p>You will receive numerical grades for your thesis and for each option course. Based on these grades and those for the first year courses, the examiners may award an overall pass grade, a pass with merit or a pass with distinction for the course. There is a prize for the best thesis and a prize for best overall performance in written papers.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Each year around 10-20 MPhil students proceed to the DPhil in Economics at Oxford. Others go on to doctoral programmes elsewhere or embark on careers as professional economists in the private or public sector.</p><p>Examples from recent graduating cohorts include doctoral programmes at Cambridge, Harvard, MIT, EUI, NYU, Northwestern and Stanford; employment with the Bank of England, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank, ODI Fellow, Morgan Stanley London, Goldman Sachs, Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the UK Government.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

Students admitted to the joint MPhil + DPhil in Economics will first complete the two-year MPhil in Economics and then (subject to satisfactorily passing) automatically progress to the three- to four-year DPhil in Economics.", "about": "<div class=\"field-item even\"><div id=\"content-tab\"><p>If you intend on studying the MPhil followed by the DPhil in Economics at Oxford, and if you have had substantial economics training and exceptional results in your prior studies, this is the right programme for you. Automatically progressing from MPhil to DPhil (subject to satisfactorily passing) reduces the uncertainty regarding the transition from MPhil to DPhil.</p><p>A DPhil at Oxford is the equivalent to a PhD at most other institutions. The structure of the MPhil + DPhil programme is similar to that of the integrated five-year PhD (sometimes called MRes-PhD) at leading economics graduate schools worldwide.</p><p>Students who have experience in graduate work in economics or related fields, or for example have completed the <a href=\"//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-economics-development\">MSc in Economics for Development </a>may wish to apply directly to the DPhil in Economics.  </p><p>MPhil + DPhil students will join one or more of the department's research groups, becoming part of a vibrant educational research community with an active set of doctoral student-led events, seminars and conferences. You will have opportunities to present your work at a variety of seminars and sessions in the department.</p><p>To enable the new joint programme to offer more rigour and exposure to the research frontier for future DPhil students, the department has made the MPhil programme more flexible.</p><h3>MPhil</h3><h4>First year</h4><p>The first year of the MPhil in Economics programme starts with a non-examined preparatory course in mathematical methods. The first two terms of the academic year focus on three compulsory courses in the central areas of microeconomics, macroeconomics and econometrics. The three courses are offered on two levels. Though most MPhil students will take the courses on the \"core\" level, MPhil + DPhil students will be expected to take one or more of the three courses at the \"advanced\" level in the first year and to take additional advanced courses in the second year. In the third term of the first year, you will choose from two entirely new courses in Empirical Research Methods and Further Mathematics Methods. These courses will provide the specialised skills needed for academic or non-academic careers in our data-rich world and the technical tools for research in economics.</p><h4>Second year</h4><p>In the second year, you will take four option courses. The option courses build on the first-year training and provide deeper and broader training in your areas of interest. You can take advanced-level courses in macroeconomics, microeconomics, econometrics and empirical research methods covering recent developments in theory and analytical techniques. Other option courses are designed to develop knowledge and understanding of theory, empirical techniques and debates within specialist fields of economics. These include behavioural economics, development economics, economic history, financial economics, international trade, labour economics and public economics.</p><p>The second important component of the second year is the required thesis, supervised by a member of the department.</p><h3>DPhil</h3><p>In order to progress to the DPhil element of this course, you will be required to satisfactorily pass the MPhil element first.</p><p>You will then start the DPhil as a Probationer Research Student (PRS). You may take additional courses from the MPhil menu to deepen and broaden your economic training, while starting to work on your first research project. The PRS status allows for a smooth transition from learning about economic research to producing new economic insights yourself.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Department of Economics and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Department of Economics.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><h4>MPhil</h4><p>The three compulsory core courses in microeconomics, macroeconomics and econometrics are examined before the start of the third term of the first year of the MPhil.</p><p>The required thesis is an important component of the second year of the MPhil, and is supervised by a member of the department. The thesis is usually expected to contain some original research. It can be incorporated into a DPhil thesis.</p><p>You will receive numerical grades for your thesis and for each option course. Based on these grades and those for the first year courses, the examiners may award an overall pass grade, a pass with merit or a pass with distinction for the course. There is a prize for the best thesis and a prize for the best overall performance in written papers.</p><h4>DPhil</h4><p>Once you have satisfactorily passed and completed the MPhil component, you will normally be admitted to the DPhil as a Probationer Research Student. You are first required to transfer to DPhil status. The Transfer of Status requires the completion of the Qualifying Examinations, necessary coursework, and an interview with two assessors appointed by the department, at which you will present an outline of your proposed thesis and a piece of written work relevant to the thesis. The transfer is normally expected to be completed by the end of the fourth term, and no later than six terms from admission to Probationer Research Student status. In exceptional circumstances, the department may waive the requirement for Transfer of Status and students may progress directly to DPhil status.</p><p>Upon a successful transfer to DPhil status, you will be required to confirm your DPhil status no later than nine terms after admission to Probationer Research Student status. Candidates for Confirmation of Status are required to present a research paper at a workshop or seminar, present a detailed outline of the complete thesis and some complete draft chapters, and will be interviewed by an assessor.</p><p>The award of the DPhil degree is based on a thesis of not more than 100,000 words in length. It should constitute a significant and substantial piece of research, of a kind which might reasonably be expected of a diligent and competent student in three years of full-time study. The maximum time allowed for completion of the DPhil degree is four years. Extensions can be granted if required.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>The interests and strengths of the department's doctoral students are many and diverse and this is reflected in the positions they take up after graduation: most take up tenure track or postdoc positions in academia; others find employment in government, international organisations, or the private sector. The international reputation of Oxford’s doctoral programme also means that its DPhil graduates can be found making a contribution in many different parts of the world.</p><p>The department recognises the importance of helping doctoral students find suitable employment and its placement efforts are directed by a senior member of the faculty. The department provides advice and help on all aspects of the job application process, including limited financial assistance to cover expenses.   <br/><br/></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

The course is complemented by practical exercises, simulations and workshops in international negotiations, crisis management, media interview techniques and effective public speaking.</li><li>International Politics treats key concepts in International Relations leading to central issues in world politics, with particular emphasis on current dynamics in the international system.</li><li>Public International Law expounds the principles, processes and institutions of a key foundation of international society, namely international law. Legal reasoning is applied to the issues that populate the contemporary diplomatic agenda.</li><li>International Trade and Finance covers the basics of international trade theory and macroeconomics, and focuses on such applied and political economy topics as trade liberalisation, globalisation, international resource transfers and development.</li></ul><p>In addition to the four taught courses above, the MSt in Diplomatic Studies requires completion of a substantial individual research project. A supervised dissertation of up to 15,000 words is done on an approved course-related topic of personal interest. To help students plan, structure and conduct their research, the DSP includes a compulsory introductory course in research methods for the social sciences.</p><p>Optional, supplementary courses include English language classes (to help non-native speakers of English polish their oral and written proficiency in the language) and Academic Literacy, which assists students to develop advanced skills in preparing and presenting their academic work.</p><p>The programme is delivered through a variety of lectures, seminars, workshops and small group tutorials. While the number of contact hours is likely to vary each year, these typically amount to 180 lectures/seminars and 24 tutorials.</p><p>As part of the course in diplomatic practice, the DSP normally includes study visits to government departments, international organisations and business and media institutions in the United Kingdom and Europe. A study tour to Ireland or Scotland may also take place.</p><p>Diplomatic Studies Programme (DSP) participants are typically early- to mid-career diplomats who resume their careers on successful completion of the course, but applications are also accepted from candidates with professional experience and academic qualifications in related fields. The annual intake has a global reach, and participants come from a wide range of countries. This creates a rich and immersive experience, where students learn as much from their peers as they do from the world-class scholars and practitioners who lecture on the programme. The resulting networking opportunities are a major attraction of the DSP.</p><p>Every DSP participant is encouraged to take advantage of the broad range of opportunities available to them as a member of the University and one of its colleges, such as attending lectures, engaging in debates and participating in Oxford’s numerous clubs and societies.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Department for Continuing Education and this role will usually be performed by the Course Director.</p><p>It is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. A supervisor may be found outside the Department for Continuing Education.</p><p>MSt students usually meet their supervisor up to 14 times (in hourly sessions). However, such sessions may be replaced with the equivalent time spent on the provision of written feedback.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>In addition to the dissertation, the four taught courses are assessed by four year-end examinations, comprising mainly of essay questions, but they may also require answers in the form of a position paper, a report, a speech, a mini case study or in a specific professionally-structured format (eg a diplomatic telegram).</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>DSP alumni have progressed to senior positions in their respective diplomatic services, within ministries and in international organisations.

The degree and expectations for both modes of study are equally rigorous. Part-time students take their classes with the full-time students, but spread over two years to accommodate work and personal circumstances. </p><p>The MSc is comprised of compulsory courses, option subjects and a dissertation. </p><p>Full-time students will be expected to spend around 40 hours studying each week during term, and to undertake some further study during vacations. During the first two terms you will be advised to divide your time between the core course and your other courses as follows:</p><ul><li>At least ten hours per week preparation for the core course</li><li>At least eight hours per week preparation for each option/compulsory course</li><li>Four and a half to six hours per week in seminars (90 minutes for each course).</li></ul><p>Part-time students will be expected to commit to a proportional workload. </p><p>The part-time student has the following schedule:</p><p>Year 1:</p><ul><li>Michaelmas Term: Core Course (compulsory), Research Design and Data Collection (compulsory),</li><li>Hilary Term: Core Course (compulsory), one Option Course</li><li>Trinity Term: Academic Skills course (compulsory)</li></ul><p>Year 2:</p><ul><li>Michaelmas Term: two Option Courses</li><li>Hilary Term: two Option Courses</li><li>Trinity Term: Dissertation (compulsory), Academic Skills Course (recommended).</li></ul><p>Please see the <a href=\"https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/admissions/postgraduate-taught/part-time-msc-criminology-and-criminal-justice\">part-time MSc webpage</a> for further details of the part-time course.</p><h3>Compulsory courses</h3><p>Compulsory courses run weekly during the first two terms: Criminological Theories and Criminal Justice in Michaelmas and Hilary terms and Research Design and Data Collection in Michaelmas Term. A further compulsory (but non-examined) course is run weekly in the third term. </p><h4>Criminological Theories and Criminal Justice</h4><p>The course begins by exploring the key cross-cutting themes of race, gender, and global approaches in criminology. This course develops understanding of the organising categories and central claims of a range of modern criminological perspectives of crime and social control. It will equip you to recognise the main problems, questions, dichotomies and ideas that have shaped modern criminological thought, to understand the nature of ‘theory’ and ‘explanation’ within criminology, and to both appreciate and critique the history and development of criminological thought.</p><p>The course explores criminological and global understanding of criminal justice/penal institutions and processes. The course introduces you to research on these processes, their underlying competing theoretical perspectives, and contemporary issues and controversies in criminal justice and punishment. The course encourages you to think about the role of the state/criminal law in the regulation of human behaviour and the place and limitations of criminal justice interventions in producing safe societies.</p><p>Part-time students take this course in their first year of study.</p><h4>Research Design and Data Collection</h4><p>This compulsory course, which runs in the first term, is focused on the challenges and the opportunities that different methods of data collection have for validity and reliability of data. Methods include experiments and quasi-experiments; questionnaires and survey research; field research, and the collection of written documents. The scientific method, theory testing and research design will also be discussed. Ethical concerns are given special emphasis. Part-time students take this course in the first term of their first year of study.</p><h4>Academic Skills for Criminologists</h4><p>This final compulsory course runs in the third term. Weekly seminars focus on developing academic skills and supporting students in the development of their dissertations.</p><h3>Option subjects</h3><p>Full-time students will take five option modules over the first and second terms of the year. Part-time students take a total of five option modules across the two years of study. Option modules run for eight weeks in each term. Recent option modules have included:</p><ul><li>Race and Gender</li><li>Sentencing</li><li>Public and Private Policing </li><li>Research Methods</li><li>Prisons</li><li>Politics of Crime Control</li><li>Criminal Justice, Migration and Citizenship</li><li>Crime and the Family</li><li>Victims and Restorative Justice</li><li>Transitional Justice</li><li>Risk, Security and Criminal Justice</li><li>The Death Penalty</li><li>Youth Justice</li><li>Theorising Punishment</li><li>Psychology, Law and Criminal Justice</li><li>Public Opinion and Criminal Justice</li><li>Criminology and the Car</li></ul><p>Please note that not all options run every year. </p><h3>Further information about studying part-time</h3><p>The MSc Criminology and Criminal Justice is not available by distance learning. Although there will be no requirement to reside in Oxford, part-time students must attend the Centre for Criminology at least two days per week in term-time: (October and November, mid-January to mid-March, and late April to mid-June) for lectures, seminars, and supervision meetings.</p><p>You cannot be enrolled in the part-time course if you need a visa to study in the UK.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Centre for Criminology and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Centre for Criminology. Students meet with their supervisor once a term.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>The Criminological Theories and Criminal Justice course assessment will either be conducted by timed examination or submission.</p><p>Research methods courses are examined by means of an assessment to be submitted at the end of the relevant term. These courses also have some term-time assignments which are assessed on a pass/fail basis.</p><p>All other options are examined by means of an assessed essay, also to be submitted at the end of the term in which the option runs.</p><p>In addition to the options you take, you will write a dissertation during the third term. Part-time students will write their dissertations in the third term of their second year, but will be encouraged to start planning their dissertation from their first year. The dissertation will be researched and written independently, with only minimum guidance from your dissertation supervisor. This is also supported by a compulsory but non-assessed course, Academic Skills for Criminologists, attended by both full-time and part-time students. </p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Graduates from the programme have recently gone on into the following areas:</p><ul><li>research careers</li><li>government departments and criminal justice agencies</li><li>voluntary organisations in the crime and justice field</li><li>international organisations, such as the UNODC.</li></ul><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

Some schemes, such as the Joint Max Planck Training Programme in Quantum Materials or the Large-Scale facility studentships (eg the <a href=\"https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Careers/Students/PhD-Studentships.html\">Diamond Doctoral Studentship Programme</a>) require a co-supervisor from outside the University (see <a href=\"https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/study/postgraduates/dphil-condensed-matter-physics\">course page</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/study/postgraduates\">department website</a> for details). In all these cases, your main University supervisor will at all times be responsible for your progress and for ensuring that the project is of suitable content and level to satisfy the normal expectations of a DPhil at the University.</p><p>The frequency of student-supervisor meetings varies depending on the nature of the project; students should expect to interact with supervisors regularly, eg weekly or, in some cases, monthly. Most supervisors run an extended research group, including several DPhil students and post-docs, who interact very frequently (usually on a daily basis). New students will also be welcome in the wider Oxford Physics community, currently hosting over 350 DPhil students, with multiple opportunities of mutual support and social interactions.</p><p>You are strongly encouraged to contact potential supervisors for further information.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>At the end of the first year you are expected to submit a report on your research and to defend it in an interview with the Graduate Studies Panel and a specialist reader. The panel will determine whether you can transfer status from Probationer Research Student (PRS) to DPhil student.</p><p>Towards the end of the second year, you will present a poster in an open session, attended by the Graduate Studies Panel and many members of the Condensed Matter Physics sub-department. Discussion of your research project with panel members and others at the poster session will contribute to the decision whether to confirm your status as DPhil student the following year.  This decision will be usually taken at the beginning of the third year, following an interview with the Graduate Studies Panel, focussing on your current results and your thesis plans.</p><p>At the end of the third year, you are expected to give a talk, attended the Graduate Studies Panel and many members of the Condensed Matter Physics sub-department, and to answer questions following your presentation.  </p><p>You will be expected to submit a substantial original thesis after three or, at most, four years from the date of admission. To be successfully awarded a DPhil you will need to defend your thesis orally (viva voce) in front of two appointed examiners (one internal and one external).  Most students would have published one or more original research paper by the time they are awarded a DPhil.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Candidates for a DPhil in Condensed Matter Physics will have demonstrated a strong grounding on the relevant physics foundations, combined with experimental and analytical skills (eg the ability of design their own experiments to test hypotheses), strong motivation and resilience and the ability to manage their workload independently, often under time pressure – all qualities that are much sought after by potential employers.  Therefore, a DPhil in Condensed Matter Physics serves as a broad high-level qualification, providing a springboard for a variety of careers in research and beyond. Past students have found careers in academic and industrial research organisations, the financial sector, information technology, consultancy, media etc. Some go on to further training in, for example, medicine and law.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

In the case of students who require specific help to adjust to an academic programme or to a new range of skills, the supervisor will work with them to ensure that they have additional support.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>All students will be initially admitted to the status of Probationer Research Student (PRS). Within a maximum of six terms as a PRS student (and normally by the fourth term) you will be expected to apply for transfer of status from Probationer Research Student to DPhil status.</p><p>A successful transfer of status from PRS to DPhil status will require satisfactory completion of any compulsory training courses (e.g. research integrity, teaching training) and submission of written work. Students who are successful at transfer will also be expected to apply for and gain confirmation of DPhil status within nine terms of admission, to show that your work continues to be on track. You will be expected to teach at least two sets of classes before confirmation of status.</p><p>Both milestones normally involve an interview with two assessors (other than your supervisor) and therefore provide important experience for the final oral examination whilst also ensuring you are making satisfactory progress and that your work is of DPhil quality.</p><p>You will be expected to submit a substantial original thesis which should not exceed 250 pages after at most four years from the date of admission.

Core course: The Colonial, the Postcolonial, the World – Literature, Contexts and Approaches</h4><p>The ‘A’ course, which runs in Michaelmas term, comprises eight seminars and is intended to provide a range of perspectives on some of the core debates, themes and issues shaping the study of world and postcolonial literatures in English. Each seminar will be led by a member of the Faculty of English or other relevant faculty and will include one or more short presentations from students on the week’s topic. There is no assessed A course work, but students are asked to give at least one presentation on the course, and to attend all the seminars. The methodologies you will encounter on this course are intended to prepare you for situating your dissertation in a chosen field of research. You should read as much as possible of the bibliography over the summer – certainly the primary literary texts listed in the seminar reading for each week. </p><h4>B. Core course: Bibliography, theories of text, history of the book, manuscript studie<strong>s</strong></h4><p>This is a compulsory, assessed course, taught via a range of lectures and seminars in each of the first two terms. The B-course for the MSt in World Literature strand introduces students to the methodologies and theories of bibliography, manuscript studies, textual scholarship, and book history framed within the broad concerns and methodologies of world literature book history and the emergence and institutionalisation of the categories of world and postcolonial literature within global and local literary spaces and the publishing industry.</p><p>The course begins in Michaelmas with a general introduction to theories and methodologies of material textual scholarship alongside an introduction to manuscript study and archive use in world literature. In late Michaelmas and Hilary it moves on to specific discussion of the institutions of world literature, culminating in student presentations and feedback on the B course essay project in Hilary term.</p><h4>C. Special options</h4><p>Students are able to choose from ‘C’ course options concerned specifically with World Literatures, as well as from any other ‘C’ course options on offer in the English MSt. Options taken by MSt students in this strand have, in recent years, included:</p><ul><li>‘Humanitarian Fictions’, looking at the revived idea of Humanitarianism in English, Anglophone, and World literary studies and raising specific questions about how the novel in particular embraces the discourse of human rights and humanitarianism to address global modernity’s emergences and discontents;</li><li>‘Literatures of Empire and Nation’, investigating the literary and cultural perceptions, misapprehensions, and evasions that accompanied empire, and the literary forms that negotiated it.</li></ul><h4>D. Dissertation</h4><p>You will write a dissertation on a subject of your choice, but related to the work you have been doing over the year. You will be assigned to a member of academic staff who will act as your supervisor.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Faculty of English and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff.

A further compulsory (but non-examined) course is run weekly in the third term. </p><h4>Criminological Theories and Criminal Justice</h4><p>The course begins by exploring the key cross-cutting themes of race, gender, and global approaches in criminology. This course develops understanding of the organising categories and central claims of a range of modern criminological perspectives of crime and social control. It will equip you to recognise the main problems, questions, dichotomies and ideas that have shaped modern criminological thought, to understand the nature of ‘theory’ and ‘explanation’ within criminology, and to both appreciate and critique the history and development of criminological thought.</p><p>The course explores criminological and global understanding of criminal justice/penal institutions and processes. The course introduces you to research on these processes, their underlying competing theoretical perspectives, and contemporary issues and controversies in criminal justice and punishment. The course encourages you to think about the role of the state/criminal law in the regulation of human behaviour and the place and limitations of criminal justice interventions in producing safe societies.</p><p>Part-time students take this course in their first year of study.</p><h4>Research Design and Data Collection</h4><p>This compulsory course, which runs in the first term, is focused on the challenges and the opportunities that different methods of data collection have for validity and reliability of data. Methods include experiments and quasi-experiments; questionnaires and survey research; field research, and the collection of written documents. The scientific method, theory testing and research design will also be discussed. Ethical concerns are given special emphasis. Part-time students take this course in the first term of their first year of study.</p><h4>Academic Skills for Criminologists</h4><p>This final compulsory course runs in the third term. Weekly seminars focus on developing academic skills and supporting students in the development of their dissertations.</p><h3>Option subjects</h3><p>Full-time students will take five option modules over the first and second terms of the year.

Reading, completion of written assignments and presentations will be undertaken in addition to the teaching days. Many students find it effective to set aside at least six to seven hours a week for private study.</p><div><h4>1. Children and Adolescents</h4><p>This pathway seeks to enable students to adapt their knowledge and skills in CBT for working with children, young people and families, with a focus on understanding how developmental and systemic issues can contribute to the development and maintenance of psychological difficulties during childhood and adolescence. The course offers high quality workshops across a range of clinical presentations, including anxiety, OCD, depression, PTSD, behavioural difficulties and self-harm, and considers how to adapt practice for working with neurodiversity and deliver parent-led CBT. Some teaching on relevant topics is shared with students on the CBT for comorbid, chronic and systemic difficulties pathways, or offered as open workshops, which enables students to interact and share knowledge and learning with a broader range of practitioners.</p><p>During the course, students are expected to carry out CBT with at least three suitable patients, and will receive two hours of small group clinical supervision on a bi-weekly basis with an experienced CBT therapist.</p><p>The course begins with a two-day induction block and then attendance is required for two days bi-weekly, for training workshops. The duration of this course is five months and it runs from March to July.</p><p>Please note, the teaching of the Children and Adolescents (C&amp;A) pathway overlaps with that of the CBT for comorbid, chronic and systemic difficulties (CCSD) pathway and students will share some of the study days. However, students are either registered for the C&amp;A pathway or the CCSD pathway, this is not a combined award. Due to the overlap in course content, students cannot progress from the C&amp;A course to the CCSD course to achieve a PG Diploma (and vice versa), nor can a student combine C&amp;A and CCSD courses as part of the Clinical MSc pathway.</p><h4>2. CBT for comorbid, chronic and systemic difficulties (formerly Complex Presentations)</h4></div><p>This specialism seeks to enable students to add to their existing knowledge of cognitive behavioural therapy, models, concepts and interventions specific to working with clinical presentations which are characterised by issues associated with comorbidity and/or chronicity of emotional disorders or where systematic factors play a role in maintaining current problems.</p><p>There is an emphasis on developing CBT knowledge and skills in delivering formulation driven CBT interventions, this includes using CBT when working with chronic and recurrent depression, generalised anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, developmental trauma, harmful behaviours, personality difficulties, psychosis and bi-polar disorder and adapting CBT to work with neurodiversity. The course aims to enable students to establish and practise a repertoire of cognitive behavioural skills for use with comorbid, chronic and systemic problems. Some teaching on relevant topics is shared with students on the Children and Adolescent pathway.</p><p>During the course students are expected to carry out CBT with at least three suitable patients presenting with problems impacted by chronicity, comorbidity or systemic factors and will receive, on a bi-weekly basis, two hours of small group CBT clinical supervision facilitated by an experienced CBT therapist.</p><p>The course begins with a two-day induction block and then attendance is required for two days bi-weekly, for training workshops. The duration of this course is five months and it runs from March to July.</p><p>Please note, the teaching of the CBT for comorbid, chronic and systemic difficulties pathway overlaps with that of the Children and Adolescents pathway and students will share some of the study days. However, students are either registered for the CCSD pathway or the C&amp;A pathway, this is not a combined award. Due to the overlap in course content, students cannot progress from the CCSD course to the C&amp;A course to achieve a PG Diploma (and vice versa), nor can a student combine CCSD and C&amp;A courses as part of the Clinical MSc pathway.</p><h4>3. Psychological Trauma and Personality Development</h4><p>This innovative programme offers comprehensive, specialist training in CBT with a strong grounding in current psychological and CBT theories and research. It is designed to offer an in-depth understanding of the range of difficulties experienced by those who have suffered adversity and psychological trauma, alongside an in-depth understanding of the development of personality traits. The course highlights the CBT principles, theory and research that can guide optimal treatment delivery to people struggling with the legacy of trauma and/or with personality issues.</p><p>Twenty-one days of training and supervision are spread over an academic year, between September and July. . Five days of teaching across September and October (a combination of taught material and self-directed study), are followed by four intensive four- day teaching blocks.. There are four summative assignments spread out over the period of training. Over the duration of the course, students are normally expected to engage in CBT with at least one patient with a trauma history and at least one patient with personality issues. Students are also expected to complete therapy with at least one patient over the duration of the course, although we encourage students to complete CBT with more than one patient before the end of this training.</p><p>Therapy with patients must demonstrate the specialist CBT skills and knowledge relevant to working with patients who have experienced psychological trauma and/or struggle with personality issues. Small group supervision from specialists is offered within each block and between training blocks (10 supervision sessions in total).</p><p>One training day in each block is open to a wider clinical audience. This enables course participants to interact and share with a broader group of specialist practitioners.</p><h4>4. Psychosis and Bipolar</h4><p>This specialism seeks to enable students to develop a sound understanding of cognitive behavioural models of psychosis and bipolar and the related evidence base; competence in engaging, assessing and developing collaborative formulations with individuals with psychotic and bipolar presentations; and competence to deliver high quality, individualised, evidence-based interventions in accordance with NICE guidance, the competence framework for work with people with psychosis and bipolar disorder (Roth &amp; Pilling 2013), and the Health Education England national curriculum for CBT for severe mental health presentations.</p><p>The course comprises teaching over three terms: running from September 2024 to the end of June 2025. Teaching and supervision typically take place on Thursdays and students should keep all Thursdays during term time free for course related teaching, supervision, and study. There will also be some Fridays required for teaching and supervision (a total of five Fridays across terms one and two).</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Oxford Cognitive Therapy Centre and this role will usually be performed by the Course Director. Small group supervision takes place regularly in each of the specialism courses.</p><p>It is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. A suitable supervisor may be found outside the Oxford Cognitive Therapy Centre.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>Summative assessment requirements vary according to the specialism chosen.</p><h4>1.

Some teaching on relevant topics is shared with students on the Children and Adolescent pathway.</p><p>During the course students are expected to carry out CBT with at least three suitable patients presenting with problems impacted by chronicity, comorbidity or systemic factors and will receive, on a bi-weekly basis, two hours of small group CBT clinical supervision facilitated by an experienced CBT therapist.</p><p>The course begins with a two-day induction block and then attendance is required for two days bi-weekly, for training workshops. The duration of this course is five months and it runs from March to July.</p><p>Please note, the teaching of the CBT for comorbid, chronic and systemic difficulties pathway overlaps with that of the Children and Adolescents pathway and students will share some of the study days. However, students are either registered for the CCSD pathway or the C&amp;A pathway, this is not a combined award. Due to the overlap in course content, students cannot progress from the CCSD course to the C&amp;A course to achieve a PG Diploma (and vice versa), nor can a student combine CCSD and C&amp;A courses as part of the Clinical MSc pathway.</p><h4>3. Psychological Trauma and Personality Development</h4><p>This innovative programme offers comprehensive, specialist training in CBT with a strong grounding in current psychological and CBT theories and research. It is designed to offer an in-depth understanding of the range of difficulties experienced by those who have suffered adversity and psychological trauma, alongside an in-depth understanding of the development of personality traits. The course highlights the CBT principles, theory and research that can guide optimal treatment delivery to people struggling with the legacy of trauma and/or with personality issues.</p><p>Twenty-one days of training and supervision are spread over an academic year, between September and July. Five days of teaching across September and October (a combination of taught material and self-directed study), are followed by four intensive four-day teaching blocks. There are four summative assignments spread out over the period of training. Over the duration of the course, students are normally expected to engage in CBT with at least one patient with a trauma history and at least one patient with personality issues. Students are also expected to complete therapy with at least one patient over the duration of the course, although we encourage students to complete CBT with more than one patient before the end of this training.</p><p>Therapy with patients must demonstrate the specialist CBT skills and knowledge relevant to working with patients who have experienced psychological trauma and/or struggle with personality issues. Small group supervisions from specialists is offered within each block and between training blocks (10 supervision session in total).</p><p>One training day in each block is open to a wider clinical audience. This enables course participants to interact and share with a broader group of specialist practitioners.</p><h4>4. Psychosis and Bipolar</h4><p>This specialism seeks to enable students to develop a sound understanding of cognitive behavioural models of psychosis and the related evidence base; competence in engaging, assessing and developing collaborative formulations with individuals with psychotic and bipolar presentations and competence to deliver high quality, individualised, evidence-based interventions in accordance with NICE guidance and the competence framework for work with people with psychosis and bipolar disorder (Roth &amp; Pilling 2013), and the Health Education England national curriculum for CBT for severe mental health presentations.</p><p>The course comprises teaching over three terms: running from September 2024 to the end of June 2025. Teaching and supervision typically take place on Thursdays and students should keep all Thursdays during term time free for course related teaching, supervision, and study. There will also be some Fridays required for teaching and supervision (a total of five Fridays across terms one and two).</p><p>Non-teaching Thursdays will be used for small-group supervision and self-directed study throughout the year.</p><h4>Further details</h4><p>The official course title of this strand is \"MSc in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (taught)\" and its course code is TM_GT9P9C4. If you apply to be considered for this strand of the course, this title and/or course code will be visible in the Graduate Application Form, Graduate Applicant Self Service and on official documents and correspondence.</p><h3>Supervision </h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Oxford Cognitive Therapy Centre and this role will usually be performed by the Course Director. Research strand students will meet with their Supervisors, when required, and Clinical strand students will meet as part of the small group supervision required in each specialism.</p><p>It is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. A supervisor may be found outside the Oxford Cognitive Therapy Centre.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><h4><strong>Research strand (TM_GT9P9C3)</strong></h4><p>To complete the Research strand of the MSc in CBT , you will need to submit a dissertation, which comprises:</p><ul><li><p style=\"display: inline !important;\">a research paper, which is prepared to a standard that is acceptable for submission to a peer reviewed journal; and</p></li><li>a reflective critique of the research experience.</li></ul><p>The reflective critique is an opportunity for you to look back over your experience of carrying out a piece of research and taking it to the point of submission. You will need to demonstrate what you have learnt from your experience, what you would do differently with hindsight, and how your experience will inform your practice from now on.</p><h4>Clinical strand (TM_GT9P9C4)</h4><p>For the Clinical strand, summative assessment requirements vary according to the specialism that you have chosen.</p><h5>1. Children and Adolescents</h5><ul><li>Two clinical recordings</li><li>Two case reports</li></ul><h5>2. CBT for comorbid, chronic and systemic difficulties</h5><ul><li>Two clinical recordings</li><li>Two case reports</li></ul><h5>3.

The major commitment of time will be to individual study and research.</p><p>As a part-time student you will be required to attend supervision, training, seminars, milestone assessments (e.g. transfer of status) and other obligations in Oxford for a minimum of 30 days each year.</p><p>There will be flexibility in the dates and pattern of attendance, which will be determined by mutual agreement with your supervisor.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>As a student on this course you will have an identified Oxford-based supervisor who is interested in your research ideas and, in some instances, you will also need to identify a field supervisor who can closely monitor and advise on your practical research.</p><p>A good supervisory relationship is crucial to research. The relationship between supervisor and supervisee can be a very personal one, therefore it is important that you ensure that your supervisor understands the research concepts and that there is agreement about the potential and the direction of the research. Both supervisor and supervisee must be able to make a commitment to the project that will span several years and must agree to regular meetings. </p><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Oxford Cognitive Therapy Centre and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances, a supervisor may be found outside the Oxford Cognitive Therapy Centre. In such circumstances, a second internal supervisor may be appointed.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>You will be admitted initially as a Probationary Research Student (PRS), in line with University regulations on doctorates. During the probationary period, you will develop and begin work on the thesis topic. You will develop research skills through a range of training and skills development primarily offered via the Department for Continuing Education Graduate School, as well as across the University.</p><p>Students must apply for a Transfer of Status from PRS to DPhil status between the sixth and the eighth academic term after admission, each academic year at Oxford having three terms. This involves the submission of a piece of written work that is examined by two assessors, neither of whom will be your supervisors. This process is to ensure that your work is of potential DPhil quality and that the methodology of the research is appropriate and feasible. Upon successful completion of the Transfer of Status, you would usually undertake a period of primary fieldwork/data collection over one to two years.</p><p>You will also be required to apply for a Confirmation of Status as DPhil sometime between the 12th and 18th term after admission. This will also involve the submission of a piece of written work that is assessed by two assessors, neither of whom are your supervisors. The Confirmation of Status assessment is different to the Transfer of Status assessment as the assessors will be focusing on how the research is progressing, the quality of the draft chapters/papers, and on the plan for completion. The assessors will be looking to ensure that you are making the appropriate amount of progress in the development of your thesis, so that thesis submission will be achieved within the time limit.</p><p>You will be expected to submit a substantive academic thesis of around 50,000 words after six or, at most, eight years from the date of admission. To be successfully awarded a DPhil in Evidence Based Health Care you will need to defend your thesis orally (viva voce) in front of two appointed examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>DPhil students on this course are expected to be established CBT practitioners and the extensive research that they carry out will further their development as a specialist practitioner.

The nature of the work will differ depending upon whether the project involves work in a laboratory or a computer based project. A variety of types of projects are possible, mixing laboratory work with data analysis. Experimental work will be mixed with group discussions with the research team with an opportunity for you to present your results and future plans. Termly reports are submitted by you, your supervisor and the Director of Graduate Studies. You will also have regular interactions with your college tutor. Various training courses are required to be taken in each year of the DPhil and these depend on the nature of the project. Towards the end of your first year, you will be planning your transfer report, which is an important milestone to assess progress and next steps.</p><h4>Year two</h4><p>A very similar year to year one with ongoing research work and a significant amount of literature reviewing to make sure the project fits in with current knowledge. During this year, many DPhil students start putting down the basis of their thesis introduction. There will be opportunities to attend local conferences and if significant progress has been made, you will submit abstracts, normally in the form of a poster presentation. During year two, you should start putting your research results into a thesis plan.</p><h4>Year three</h4><p>This is a key year for you where the thesis needs to take shape. You should have a degree of autonomy during the final year, managing your future direction in discussions with your supervisor. Day to day tasks are very similar to year two but you will start putting results in a chapter format. Many students submit or start compiling research papers in year three. Submitting a research abstract to a large international conference should be a target for all DPhil students in year three. By term nine you will undergo a confirmation of status with two internal assessors. This will go over the background to the research, the contents of chapters and the plan for completing the research work and writing the thesis. It is expected that all DPhil students give a WRH departmental seminar in the final year of their DPhil.</p><h3>Part-time study</h3><p>It is possible to study for a doctorate on a part-time basis. Completing the DPhil on a part-time basis normally requires between six and eight years of study, compared with a full-time DPhil which normally takes three to four years to complete. Part-time study is not suitable for all projects and you will need to check with your supervisor that they are able to accommodate part-time study.</p><p>As a part-time student, attendance is required for a minimum of thirty days of university-based work each year, to be arranged with the agreement of their supervisor, for the period that their names remain on the Register of Graduate Students unless individually dispensed by the Board. During a candidate’s probationary period the attendance arrangements must take account of relevant induction and training events scheduled by the Board. You will have the opportunity to tailor your part-time research in liaison with your supervisor and agree your pattern of attendance.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Nuffield Department of Women's &amp; Reproductive Health and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Nuffield Department of Women's &amp; Reproductive Health.</p><p>You will be a member of your supervisor’s research group in which you will develop your research skills with one to one supervision. Your core supervision team will consist of your principal supervisor, and one or more additional supervisors, which can also include scientists external to Oxford University. It is anticipated that you will meet at least every two weeks with your supervisors to plan your research and review your progress. In addition, where needed, you will have support from the Director of Graduate Studies and a college advisor.</p><p>In the case of students who require specific help to adjust to an academic programme or to a new range of skills, the supervisor will work with them to ensure that they have additional support.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>All students will be initially admitted to the status of Probationer Research Student (PRS). Within a maximum of six terms as a full-time PRS student or twelve terms as a part-time PRS student, you will be expected to apply for transfer of status from Probationer Research Student to DPhil status. This application is normally made by the fourth term for full-time students and by the eighth term for part-time students.</p><p>A successful transfer of status from PRS to DPhil status will require a written report outlining your project plans and data obtained so far. Students who are successful at transfer will also be expected to apply for and gain confirmation of DPhil status to show that your work continues to be on track. This will need to be done within nine terms of admission for full-time students and eighteen terms of admission for part-time students.</p><p>Both milestones normally involve an interview with two assessors who are not directly involved in your supervision and therefore provide important experience for the final oral examination.</p><p>Full-time students will be expected to submit an original thesis of 50,000 words after three or, at most, four years from the date of admission. If you are studying part-time, you be required to submit your thesis after six or, at most, eight years from the date of admission. To be successfully awarded a DPhil in Women’s &amp; Reproductive Health you will need to defend your thesis orally (viva voce) in front of two appointed examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Graduates from the Nuffield Department of Women's &amp; Reproductive Health go on to further research in reproductive, biological and biomedical science, assisted reproduction, as well as clinical academic work and industry.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

You should expect to spend six to eight hours per week in term time in formal teaching contexts (lectures, seminar groups, tutorials, classes), which can be supplemented with attendance of the many research and visiting speaker seminars on offer; the remainder of you time (ie around 30 hours per week) should be spent on independent study and preparation of submitted work. The periods outside term time are considered to be opportunities for further independent study, consolidating and supplementing the knowledge gained during the preceding term and preparing work for examination, as well as for an appropriate break from study.</p><p>The MSc is structured around teaching for four papers:</p><h4>1. Contemporary themes in visual, material and museum anthropology</h4><p>This paper focuses on topics such as visual and material cultures; photography; digital anthropology;, art and aesthetics; film and cinema; museum, colonialism, collecting, and contemporary debates; ethics and relationships with 'source communities'; production and consumption; transnational cultural flows and the wider issues of cross-cultural investigation.</p><h4>2. Option paper</h4><p>You will select one option paper from those taught each year for students in the School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography (SAME). Titles of options available will be made known at the beginning of each academic year.</p><h4>3. Research methods in visual, material and museum anthropology</h4><p>This paper consists of two parts. Paper 3a is an outline research proposal. Paper 3b is a methods portfolio consisting of a report on trials of a research method in visual, material, and museum anthropology.</p><h4>4. Fundamental concepts in visual, material, and museum anthropology</h4><p>This paper focuses on key issues and themes in visual, material and museum anthropology, including current anthropological debates relating to materials, bodies, environments, museums, photography, film, art, archives, and digital.</p><h4>Dissertation</h4><p>You will then use the next three months to research and write a dissertation for submission in September; you will be able to choose and refine the dissertation topic in consultation with your supervisor and other tutors as appropriate, but you will be required to write the dissertation unaided as a piece of independent research.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff.

You will then start the research for their MPhil dissertation over the summer.</p><p>You should expect to spend six to eight hours per week in term time in formal teaching contexts (lectures, seminar groups, tutorials, classes), which can be supplemented with attendance of the many research and visiting speaker seminars on offer; the remainder of your time (ie around 30 hours per week) should be spent on independent study and preparation of submitted work. </p><p>The first year of the MPhil is structured around teaching for four papers. </p><h4>1. Contemporary themes in visual, material and museum anthropology</h4><p>This paper focuses on topics such as visual and material cultures; photography; digital anthropology; art and aesthetics; film and cinema; museums, colonialism, collecting, and contemporary debates; ethics and relationships with 'source communities'; production and consumption; transnational cultural flows and the wider issues of cross-cultural investigation.</p><h4>2. Option paper</h4><p>You will select one option paper from those taught each year for students in the School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography (SAME). Titles of options available will be made known at the beginning of each academic year.</p><h4>3. Research methods in visual, material and museum anthropology</h4><p>This paper consists of two parts. Paper 3a is an outline research proposal. Paper 3b is a methods portfolio consisting of a report on trials of a research method in visual, material, and museum anthropology.</p><h4>4. Fundamental concepts in visual, material, and museum anthropology</h4><p>This paper focuses on key issues and themes in visual, material and museum anthropology, including current anthropological debates relating to materials, bodies, environments, museums, photography, film, art, archives, and the digital.  </p><h3>Second year</h3><p>You will spend the summer conducting preliminary research. You will then focus principally on research and writing for your thesis in the second year, so the emphasis is on independent study.

On completion of the DPhil, you will have extended the boundaries of knowledge and undertaken an original empirical study in an aspect of translational health sciences as defined above, and to be ready to embark on independent applied research in this field.</p><p>Research topics relevant to this programme may pertain (but need not be restricted) to the following:</p><ul><li>How to influence behaviour eg encourage clinicians to use a new technology in their practice (or indeed how to get them to stop using a technology);</li><li>The extent to which a new drug, medical device or other innovation generates value for different stakeholders;</li><li>The challenges of introducing and sustaining an innovation at an organisational level;</li><li>How policy is made and what prevents it from being ‘evidence-based’;</li><li>How the regulatory environment can both enable and constrain innovation in healthcare settings;</li><li>How technologies can (and why they do not always) support care practices;</li><li>How patients and citizens might play an active role in research and dissemination;</li><li>How we decide what is right and reasonable in research;</li><li>How industry, academia and government can work together to optimise the acceleration of innovations into practice;</li><li>Implications for global knowledge transfer of international differences in health systems.</li></ul><p>It is anticipated that most students on this DPhil will have previously completed the MSc in Translational Health Sciences. Those who apply with a different masters degree will need to <a href=\"//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-translational-health-sciences%20\">complete relevant modules</a> as short courses to address gaps in knowledge or specific research skills. These will be discussed on an individual basis.</p><p>As a doctoral student on the DPhil in Translational Health Sciences, you will join other postgraduate research students in a vibrant and varied programme of peer support and extension activities, described in detail under 'resources' below. The department will also encourage and support you to actively build your networks with, and gain experience in, settings outside academia such as healthcare organisations, policymaking, industry and regulation.</p><p>The department views the DPhil in Translational Health Sciences both as an extension of the MSc (for students seeking an academic career) and as a means of inspiring the MSc students and adding vibrancy to the MSc course. To that end, you will be encouraged to present your emerging research to MSc students in seminars or guest lectures and offer suitable small-scale projects to MSc students. </p><p>The DPhil can be studied on a full-time or part-time basis. The Departmental Postgraduate Handbook provides detailed advice and guidance on starting the DPhil, term dates, working environment, supervisor relationships and troubleshooting, pastoral support and college affiliation.  </p><p>There will be limited flexibility in the dates and pattern of attendance, which will be determined by mutual agreement with your supervisor; it is vital that you discuss this with your supervisor as part of your application process. Attendance will be required year-round, details to be determined by mutual agreement with your supervisor. You will have the opportunity to tailor your part-time study and skills training in liaison with your supervisor and agree your pattern of attendance.

Where appropriate, and relatively rarely, the second supervisor may be appointed from a different department.</p><p>Supervision will typically occur monthly for full-time students and two-monthly for part-time ones, along with additional email contact and pastoral support. Most supervisors meet students at least fortnightly in the first few terms, and this may continue throughout the studentship according to the needs of the student and the project.</p><p>On entry into the programme, you will receive a full induction and meet individually with the Director of Graduate Studies (DGS) and then twice yearly, as well as on an as-needed basis throughout your programme.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>All students will be initially admitted to the status of Probationer Research Student (PRS). Within a maximum of four terms as a full-time PRS student or eight terms as a part-time PRS student, you will be expected to apply for transfer of status from Probationer Research Student to DPhil status.</p><p>A successful transfer of status from PRS to DPhil status will require satisfactory progress, submission of a transfer report, and completion of a viva voce assessment. Students who are successful at transfer will also be expected to apply for and gain confirmation of DPhil status to show that your work continues to be on track. This will need to be done within nine terms of admission for full-time students and eighteen terms of admission for part-time students.</p><p>Both milestones normally involve an interview with two assessors (other than your supervisor) and therefore provide important experience for the final oral examination.</p><p>Full-time students will be expected to submit a substantial, original thesis after three or, at most, four years from the date of admission. If you are studying part-time, you be required to submit your thesis after six or, at most, eight years from the date of admission.</p><p>To be successfully awarded a DPhil in Translational Health Sciences, you will need to defend your thesis orally (<em>viva voce</em>) in front of two appointed examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>The MSc and DPhil in Translational Health Sciences have been designed to address a significant and urgent skills deficit in linking research discoveries to implementation in practice, service transformation and improved patient outcomes.  Such roles include (but are not limited to) the following sectors:</p><ul><li>Higher education: researchers, research managers, knowledge translation / research impact officers;</li><li>Healthcare organisations: clinical entrepreneurs, knowledge managers;</li><li>Industry: designers, research managers, academic liaison officers;</li><li>Policy: variety of local and national policy roles;</li><li>Third sector: patient advocacy, lobbying.</li></ul><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

The nature of the work will differ depending upon whether the project involves work in a laboratory or a computer based project. A variety of types of projects are possible, mixing laboratory work with data analysis. Experimental work will be mixed with group discussions with the research team with an opportunity for you to present your results and future plans. Termly reports are submitted by you, your supervisor and the Director of Graduate Studies. You will also have regular interactions with your college tutor. Various training courses are required to be taken in each year of the DPhil and these depend on the nature of the project. Towards the end of your first year, you will be planning your transfer report, which is an important milestone to assess progress and next steps.</p><h4>Year two</h4><p>A very similar year to year one with ongoing research work and a significant amount of literature reviewing to make sure the project fits in with current knowledge. During this year, many DPhil students start putting down the basis of their thesis introduction. There will be opportunities to attend local conferences and if significant progress has been made, you will submit abstracts, normally in the form of a poster presentation. During year two, you should start putting your research results into a thesis plan.</p><h4>Year three</h4><p>This is a key year for you where the thesis needs to take shape. You should have a degree of autonomy during the final year, managing your future direction in discussions with your supervisor. Day to day tasks are very similar to year two but you will start putting results in a chapter format. Many students submit or start compiling research papers in year three. Submitting a research abstract to a large international conference should be a target for all DPhil students in year three. By term nine you will undergo a confirmation of status with two internal assessors. This will go over the background to the research, the contents of chapters and the plan for completing the research work and writing the thesis. It is expected that all DPhil students give a WRH departmental seminar in the final year of their DPhil.</p><h3>Part-time study</h3><p>It is possible to study for a doctorate on a part-time basis. Completing the DPhil on a part-time basis normally requires between six and eight years of study, compared with a full-time DPhil which normally takes three to four years to complete. Part-time study is not suitable for all projects and you will need to check with your supervisor that they are able to accommodate part-time study.</p><p>As a part-time student, attendance is required for a minimum of thirty days of university-based work each year, to be arranged with the agreement of their supervisor, for the period that their names remain on the Register of Graduate Students unless individually dispensed by the Board. During a candidate’s probationary period the attendance arrangements must take account of relevant induction and training events scheduled by the Board. You will have the opportunity to tailor your part-time research in liaison with your supervisor and agree your pattern of attendance.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Nuffield Department of Women's &amp; Reproductive Health and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Nuffield Department of Women's &amp; Reproductive Health.</p><p>You will be a member of your supervisor’s research group in which you will develop your research skills with one to one supervision. Your core supervision team will consist of your principal supervisor, and one or more additional supervisors, which can also include scientists external to Oxford University. It is anticipated that you will meet at least every two weeks with your supervisors to plan your research and review your progress. In addition, where needed, you will have support from the Director of Graduate Studies and a college advisor.</p><p>In the case of students who require specific help to adjust to an academic programme or to a new range of skills, the supervisor will work with them to ensure that they have additional support.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>All students will be initially admitted to the status of Probationer Research Student (PRS). Within a maximum of six terms as a full-time PRS student or twelve terms as a part-time PRS student, you will be expected to apply for transfer of status from Probationer Research Student to DPhil status. This application is normally made by the fourth term for full-time students and by the eighth term for part-time students.</p><p>A successful transfer of status from PRS to DPhil status will require a written report outlining your project plans and data obtained so far. Students who are successful at transfer will also be expected to apply for and gain confirmation of DPhil status to show that your work continues to be on track. This will need to be done within nine terms of admission for full-time students and eighteen terms of admission for part-time students.</p><p>Both milestones normally involve an interview with two assessors who are not directly involved in your supervision and therefore provide important experience for the final oral examination.</p><p>Full-time students will be expected to submit an original thesis of 50,000 words after three or, at most, four years from the date of admission. If you are studying part-time, you be required to submit your thesis after six or, at most, eight years from the date of admission. To be successfully awarded a DPhil in Women’s &amp; Reproductive Health you will need to defend your thesis orally (viva voce) in front of two appointed examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Graduates from the Nuffield Department of Women's &amp; Reproductive Health go on to further research in reproductive, biological and biomedical science, assisted reproduction, as well as clinical academic work and industry.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

A qualifying examination in your modern language is held at the end of the third term. If your proficiency in your main language is not up to academic standards, you will prepare for an examination in that language. If, on arrival, your proficiency is judged to be up to academic standards, you will choose a different modern East Asian language for research purposes and prepare for the examination in the selected language.</p><h4>Classical Language</h4><p>You will be required to follow a general course in Classical Chinese, Classical Japanese, or Middle Korean. Instruction may take the form of lectures, text classes, or some combination of the two. You will prepare and present English translations in text classes. Depending on your ability, you may be permitted to follow more than one classical language, but you must choose only one classical language for assessment in your qualifying examination. </p><h4>Colloquium</h4><p>You will also attend throughout the year the East Asia Colloquium, for which you receive a reading list and write four essays per term. Students meet together every two weeks in a 90-minute seminar to present the gist of their essays and discuss the topic at hand. The qualifying examination for the seminar consists of an assessment of your three best essays from the twelve prepared over the year. No marks are given on each essay but you will receive comments and feedback, and you must choose and submit one essay to Examination Schools at the end of each term that you feel presents the best of your work. </p><h3>Second year</h3><p>Your second-year work has three parts.</p><h4>Thesis</h4><p>In the second year, you will spend a good portion of your time researching and writing your thesis. There are no modern language requirements, but you may opt to monitor or audit classes in a modern or classical language that you were unable to study or for which you would like further study.</p><h4>Prescribed Texts</h4><p>You will continue your study of a classical language by reading Prescribed Texts in Classical Chinese or Classical Japanese or Middle Korean. Texts are chosen in consultation with one of the Course Coordinators and drawn from canonical literature in the areas of history, literature, and philosophy. The final examination is a timed examination at the end of the second year. You have eight one-hour classes spread over three terms.</p><h4>Bibliography and Methodology</h4><p>For the Bibliography and Methodology requirement, you will choose a country specialisation (Korea, China, or Japan) and prepare answers to a series of exercises requiring you to find specific and general information in the classical bibliography and references of one of the three countries.

On completion of the DPhil, you will have extended the boundaries of knowledge and undertaken an original empirical study in an aspect of translational health sciences as defined above, and to be ready to embark on independent applied research in this field.</p><p>Research topics relevant to this programme may pertain (but need not be restricted) to the following:</p><ul><li>How to influence behaviour eg encourage clinicians to use a new technology in their practice (or indeed how to get them to stop using a technology);</li><li>The extent to which a new drug, medical device or other innovation generates value for different stakeholders;</li><li>The challenges of introducing and sustaining an innovation at an organisational level;</li><li>How policy is made and what prevents it from being ‘evidence-based’;</li><li>How the regulatory environment can both enable and constrain innovation in healthcare settings;</li><li>How technologies can (and why they do not always) support care practices;</li><li>How patients and citizens might play an active role in research and dissemination;</li><li>How we decide what is right and reasonable in research;</li><li>How industry, academia and government can work together to optimise the acceleration of innovations into practice;</li><li>Implications for global knowledge transfer of international differences in health systems.</li></ul><p>It is anticipated that most students on this DPhil will have previously completed the MSc in Translational Health Sciences. Those who apply with a different masters degree will need to <a href=\"//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-translational-health-sciences%20\">complete relevant modules</a> as short courses to address gaps in knowledge or specific research skills. These will be discussed on an individual basis.</p><p>As a doctoral student on the DPhil in Translational Health Sciences, you will join other postgraduate research students in a vibrant and varied programme of peer support and extension activities, described in detail under 'resources' below. The department will also encourage and support you to actively build your networks with, and gain experience in, settings outside academia such as healthcare organisations, policymaking, industry and regulation.</p><p>The department views the DPhil in Translational Health Sciences both as an extension of the MSc (for students seeking an academic career) and as a means of inspiring the MSc students and adding vibrancy to the MSc course. To that end, you will be encouraged to present your emerging research to MSc students in seminars or guest lectures and offer suitable small-scale projects to MSc students. </p><p>The DPhil can be studied on a full-time or part-time basis. The Departmental Postgraduate Handbook provides detailed advice and guidance on starting the DPhil, term dates, working environment, supervisor relationships and troubleshooting, pastoral support and college affiliation.  </p><p>There will be limited flexibility in the dates and pattern of attendance, which will be determined by mutual agreement with your supervisor; it is vital that you discuss this with your supervisor as part of your application process. Attendance will be required year-round, details to be determined by mutual agreement with your supervisor. You will have the opportunity to tailor your part-time study and skills training in liaison with your supervisor and agree your pattern of attendance. Please note that in-house training sessions organised by the department may take place on any day of the week and both inside and outside full-term time.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences.</p><p>You will be appointed at least two Departmental Supervisors with complementary backgrounds and interests, along with a College Advisor. Where appropriate, and relatively rarely, the second supervisor may be appointed from a different department.</p><p>Supervision will typically occur monthly for full-time students and two-monthly for part-time ones, along with additional email contact and pastoral support. Most supervisors meet students at least fortnightly in the first few terms, and this may continue throughout the studentship according to the needs of the student and the project.</p><p>On entry into the programme, you will receive a full induction and meet individually with the Director of Graduate Studies (DGS) and then twice yearly, as well as on an as-needed basis throughout your programme.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>All students will be initially admitted to the status of Probationer Research Student (PRS). Within a maximum of four terms as a full-time PRS student or eight terms as a part-time PRS student, you will be expected to apply for transfer of status from Probationer Research Student to DPhil status.</p><p>A successful transfer of status from PRS to DPhil status will require satisfactory progress, submission of a transfer report, and completion of a viva voce assessment. Students who are successful at transfer will also be expected to apply for and gain confirmation of DPhil status to show that your work continues to be on track. This will need to be done within nine terms of admission for full-time students and eighteen terms of admission for part-time students.</p><p>Both milestones normally involve an interview with two assessors (other than your supervisor) and therefore provide important experience for the final oral examination.</p><p>Full-time students will be expected to submit a substantial, original thesis after three or, at most, four years from the date of admission. If you are studying part-time, you be required to submit your thesis after six or, at most, eight years from the date of admission.</p><p>To be successfully awarded a DPhil in Translational Health Sciences, you will need to defend your thesis orally (<em>viva voce</em>) in front of two appointed examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>The MSc and DPhil in Translational Health Sciences have been designed to address a significant and urgent skills deficit in linking research discoveries to implementation in practice, service transformation and improved patient outcomes.  Such roles include (but are not limited to) the following sectors:</p><ul><li>Higher education: researchers, research managers, knowledge translation / research impact officers;</li><li>Healthcare organisations: clinical entrepreneurs, knowledge managers;</li><li>Industry: designers, research managers, academic liaison officers;</li><li>Policy: variety of local and national policy roles;</li><li>Third sector: patient advocacy, lobbying.</li></ul><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

There will be daily homework exercises as well as memorization of aspects of Sanskrit grammar and vocabulary. At the same time you will attend a class on methods in the study of classical Indian culture, attend lectures and seminars, and write several tutorial essays related to general themes in Indian religion. </p><p>Following successful qualifying examination at the end of the first year, you will enter the second part of the course, which continues to the end of the second year. You will have regular classes in reading Sanskrit texts. For these classes you will prepare texts in advance and, along with your classmates, will read and translate them into English. Your classes will cover prescribed lists of texts that belong to two Indian religious traditions, which you will have chosen from among four options: Shaiva, Vaishnava, Buddhist, and the mainstream tradition that derives from the Vedas. You will also be given regular tutorials in these two traditions, for which you will read assigned secondary sources and prepare essays to discuss with your tutors. There are also lectures and seminars regularly offered. Students who come to Oxford with a significant background in Sanskrit may with permission attend advanced classes, or other language classes offered at Oxford, though they will not be explicitly examined in these languages. All students are encouraged to attend lectures both in the Faculty and elsewhere in the university, as their work permits and their interests dictate.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>At the end of the first year of the course there is a written examination of your ability to translate prepared texts in Sanskrit and of your knowledge of Sanskrit grammar. In the second year, there is a timed examination in the textual component of the course. This paper has two halves, one for translation of portions of texts that you have read during the course, and the other for translation from comparable sources in Sanskrit that you have not read before in a class. There are also two timed examinations on the history of classical Indian religion, with the subject matter divided more or less chronologically. In these papers you will write essays in response to questions posed on topics covered by your tutorials.</p><p>In addition to the three timed examinations you will also write a thesis. It is usual to write the thesis mostly during the vacations, and it has to be handed in at the beginning of the final term. Tutors will discuss the choice of topic with you and supply a bibliography, and may criticise a first draft, but the final version of the thesis is entirely your own work. If you are subsequently admitted for a research degree, a successful MPhil thesis may form the basis of your doctoral dissertation.</p><p>Further information on the course, and the examination process, can be found in the course handbook via the course webpage on the faculty's website.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Asian and Middle Eastern studies graduates have found employment in many and diverse fields including business, finance, law, civil service, journalism, government and industry.</p><p>Many graduates have also undertaken further research into subjects linked with Asian and Middle Eastern studies and have pursued successful careers in the academic world, education and in museums.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

You will meet with your supervisor at least at the start of each term.  </p><p>You will have a departmental supervisor, normally your MPhil thesis supervisor in your main area of interest, who may also provide some of your teaching but will advise on option choices and monitor overall progress. Each member of the academic staff in Classical archaeology offers a different subject in his or her areas of specialism in each of the first two terms, so students can normally choose from about eight different subjects each term, covering major topics from the Bronze Age to the Byzantine period.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>The three subject options are examined by pairs of pre-set essays, submitted early in the following terms. The period paper, which is the focus of the final term of the first year, is assessed by written examination at the end of that term.</p><p>The thesis subject is decided by the end of the first year, with any fieldwork taking place in the long vacation, and the research and writing occupy the second and third terms of the second year. There is also a compulsory viva voce examination for each year of the course, which is held in week nine of Trinity term.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Most graduates from the MPhil in Classical Archaeology continue to further degree programmes in Classical Archaeology either at Oxford or at leading universities elsewhere, predominantly in the UK and the USA. Others find careers in education, museums, commercial archaeology and the heritage industry.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

Teaching is provided through a mixture of classes and tutorials. A core course provides an introduction to the medieval Celtic languages through the close study of texts in class, while other areas are taught through tutorials which may be supplemented by lecture series. A weekly Celtic research seminar brings all students together with talks by invited, mainly external speakers, run jointly in collaboration with the Centre for Advanced Welsh and Celtic Studies, Aberystwyth.</p><p>You may be required to take an intensive course in a modern Celtic language as a condition of admission, either in the long vacation prior to the admission or in the long vacation following the third term of your course of instruction.</p><p>The MPhil in Celtic Studies provides an appropriate introduction for you if you are contemplating higher research in a DPhil or PhD programme in this area.</p><p>Students are required to take one or two core options, from a choice of: (i) Celtic linguistics; (ii) Welsh literature; or (iii) medieval Irish literature; plus one or two special options, which may develop one of these areas in more depth; or may be another ancient or modern Celtic language and its associated culture; or may be on a historical or other relevant topic. You will write a dissertation that typically arises out of one of the options studied; and will also be required to develop a reading knowledge of a modern Celtic language which you have not previously studied at degree level.</p><p>Teaching for the course is shared among three faculties, English, History and Linguistics. Faculty members with particular expertise in Celtic topics include Prof David Willis (course director; Celtic linguistics, Welsh language and culture); Prof Mark Williams (medieval Irish and Welsh literature; modern reception of Celtic literature); Dr Conor O’Brien (early medieval history of Britain and Ireland); Dr Holly Kennard (modern Breton linguistics); Nora Baker (Irish language instructor); and Llewelyn Hopwood (Welsh language instructor).</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Humanities Division  and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Humanities Division.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>The course assessment consists of the following elements:</p><ul><li>three essay submissions for each of the core and option papers </li><li>a dissertation on an approved topic.</li></ul><p>The option papers allow you to focus on both Irish and Welsh or on only one of the two. If you wish, you may also select aspects of the history of the Celtic-speaking peoples, as well as linguistic and literary options. Although the regulations are flexible enough to allow for individual preferences, there is a compulsory language element requiring the close study of texts in the original language(s).</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Many MPhil students proceed to doctoral degrees at Oxford or at other universities.

They have the opportunity to work with outstanding structural biologists, continuing to develop structural methods, or to investigate the molecular basis for cellular processes, including in infection or membrane biology. Collaborative projects are highly encouraged, with students building supervisory teams, which contain their primary structural biology supervisor as well as others with expertise in complementary methods or particular biological questions. </p><p>Training in key research techniques should include:</p><ul><li>X-ray crystallography</li><li>nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy</li><li>electron cryo-microscopy and electron tomography</li><li>synchrotron radiation and integrative structural biology</li><li>high-resolution light microscopy</li><li>computational biochemistry and molecular simulations.</li></ul><p>The students write reports at the end of each rotation project and have the opportunity to discuss the report and their research project with one of the principal investigators associated with the programme. They also prepare a project proposal at the end of the first year to outline what they plan to do during their DPhil project. Both of these activities provide valuable training in proposal and report writing.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>Each student will be guided and supported by a supervisory team. The students are encouraged to be flexible about the supervisor until they arrive in Oxford, as the first week of their course is spent meeting all of those associated with the programme and making decisions about where to work during their rotation projects. A primary supervisor will be an expert in a core structural biology technique and will ensure the provision of training. Co-supervisors will bring expertise in specific methods, which may be structural or may be other techniques which enrich the training and the research. Students will receive termly progress reports from their supervisors, and in addition, the programme directors will regularly meet with students to provide guidance, support and careers advice.</p><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Medical Sciences Doctoral Training Centre. It is also not always possible to offer students their preferred supervisor, as Wellcome have guidelines about the number of students who each individual supervisor can work with. However, with such a broad pool of excellent supervisors, this is rarely a problem. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Medical Sciences Doctoral Training Centre.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>All students will be initially admitted to the status of Probationer Research Student (PRS). Within a maximum of six terms as a PRS student you will be expected to apply for transfer of status from Probationer Research Student to DPhil status.</p><p>A successful transfer of status from PRS to DPhil status will require the submission of a report on progress to date on research and future plans. Students who are successful at transfer will also be expected to apply for and gain confirmation of DPhil status within ten terms of admission, to show that your work continues to be on track.</p><p>Both milestones normally involve an interview with two assessors (other than your supervisor) and therefore provide important experience for the final oral examination.</p><p>You will be expected to submit an original thesis of up to 50,000 words within a maximum of four years from the date of admission. To be successfully awarded a DPhil in Cellular Structural Biology you will need to defend your thesis orally (viva voce) in front of two appointed examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Our programme prepares students for a wide range of future careers, providing project management experience, programming skills, and the experience of working in a precise and numerically rigorous scientific field. We equip and support our students to transition to careers in academia, industry and beyond, while ensuring that we train a cohort to continue to apply and to develop structural biology into the future.</p><p>Many graduates from this programme continue in research in prestigious laboratories worldwide and are now world-leading researchers, either as senior group leaders or in established academic posts. Many are leaders in research and development in industrial settings. Other graduates are in a wide range of different careers, including medicine, scientific administration, health management, consultancy, patent law and the civil service.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

There are multiple collaborations within and between different departments and research themes, and research interactions have been greatly enhanced and facilitated by a British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence (CRE) award, one of only six in the UK.</p><h3>Year 1</h3><p>You are provided with a co-ordinated programme of post-graduate teaching in your first year and the possibility of experiencing research in more than one laboratory.</p><p>In your first term you will attend a series of six micro-rotations where you will meet graduate students and <a href=\"https://www.medsci.ox.ac.uk/study/graduateschool/courses/dtc-structured-research-degrees/cardiovascular-science\">principal investigators working in six broad areas of cardiovascular science</a>:</p><ul><li>Atherosclerosis, Diabetes and Inflammation (academic lead <a href=\"https://www.medsci.ox.ac.uk/study/graduateschool/supervisors/charalambos-antoniades\">Charis Antoniades</a>)</li><li>Cardiac Biology and Imaging (academic lead <a href=\"https://www.medsci.ox.ac.uk/study/graduateschool/supervisors/craig-lygate\">Craig Lygate</a>)</li><li>Cardiac Signalling and Metabolism (academic lead <a href=\"https://www.medsci.ox.ac.uk/study/graduateschool/supervisors/manuela-zaccolo\">Manuela Zaccolo</a>)</li><li>Contemporary Technologies and Target Discovery (academic lead <a href=\"https://www.medsci.ox.ac.uk/study/graduateschool/supervisors/blanca-rodriguez\">Blanca Rodriguez</a> and <a href=\"https://www.medsci.ox.ac.uk/study/graduateschool/supervisors/angela-russell\">Angela Russell</a>)</li><li>Developmental Biology and Regenerative Medicine (academic lead <a href=\"https://www.medsci.ox.ac.uk/study/graduateschool/supervisors/nicola-smart\">Nicola Smart</a>)</li><li>Endothelial Cell and Vascular Biology (academic lead <a href=\"https://www.medsci.ox.ac.uk/study/graduateschool/supervisors/kim-dora\">Kim Dora</a>)</li></ul><p>Micro-rotations include attendance at lab meetings, journal clubs and hands-on experience of key experimental techniques. They are designed to give you exposure to the many possibilities for cutting-edge research projects, as well as generate interest in areas of research that you may not have had access to previously.</p><p>An important part of the student experience is graduate tutorials every Monday morning and Friday afternoon. Topics include how to choose a good scientific problem, how to choose a good supervisor, and classic experiments in cardiovascular medicine. Students give short presentations and write News and Views style articles on recent papers. In Friday tutorials students are asked to reflect on that week’s micro-rotation and start discussing which principal investigator’s project they found most interesting and why.</p><p>Mid-way through your first term in Oxford you will choose supervisors for typically two 10 to 12-week laboratory mini-rotations, which will expose you to techniques and research modalities. You will be expected to design and execute experimental protocols, critically appraise research methods and experimental results, and communicate research results and their implications to a wide audience.</p><p>Students decide their main research project from one of the mini-rotations, allowing time to develop and write a full project proposal before the second year commences. By doing this you will gain a greater understanding of the cardiovascular research field and can bring a broader perspective to your research project than is possible under the standard three-year DPhil.</p><p>The first year of your graduate studies will be overseen by an academic mentor who will monitor your academic progress and be available to offer advice and support throughout the course of your graduate studies. The department aims for you to be associated with one host laboratory for the first nine months of your graduate studies under the supervision of a laboratory mentor who will ensure you receive appropriate training in laboratory methods and in planning, executing and analysing experiments.</p><p>Once you have commenced your research projects, you will attend graduate tutorials, to present your latest results and discuss a range of research methods as well as journal clubs where you can discuss papers directly relevant to current lab projects. Your first year is monitored by presentations on your laboratory rotations, typically in the ninth week of each term, ie three times in the first year.</p><p>These regular small group meetings and social interactions help foster a distinct cadre of graduate students who share a common interest in, and enthusiasm for, cardiovascular science.</p><h3>Years 2-4</h3><p>From the second year onwards, you will spend the remainder of the programme carrying out a specific research project, under the supervision of two named supervisors.</p><p>You will have access to a wide range of training in generic research skills provided through seminars and short courses. Examples of the courses that may be available to you include:</p><ul><li>proteomic methodologies</li><li>genomics and bioinformatics</li><li>confocal microscopy and image analysis</li><li>statistics and experimental design</li><li>information technology/computing skills</li><li>written and oral presentation skills</li><li>laboratory experience.</li></ul><p>You are encouraged to develop DPhil projects that bridge the work of two separate laboratories or that involve two complementary experimental approaches. You are expected to attend regular lab meetings and take part in all departmental graduate student training and assessment sessions.</p><p>Regular mini-symposia will be held, in which first and second year students will give 15-minute presentations on their current research followed by student networking events and informal meetings with committee members.</p><p>The taught component during your programme also includes the possibility to attend final-year undergraduate lecture options, including Pharmacology and signalling, Endocrinology and metabolism, Cardiovascular science, Molecular pathology, Development and disease, Infection, Immunity and Neuroscience.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Medical Sciences Doctoral Training Centre, and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff.

You must first apply to the NIH by early December, following which interviews for admission in the following Michaelmas term (October) are held in February in Bethesda, MD by NIH, Oxford and Cambridge University staff. The programme is highly competitive and the approximate number of places available this year is shown in the Key Facts section on this page. You can also apply to the NIH MD/PhD programme.</p><p>The selected students are supported financially by the NIH but are full students of the University of Oxford or Cambridge and normally spend half their time in the UK.

In addition, you will be encouraged to make the most of the doctoral training and research methods provision available across the Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences Division. The department also provides training to all DPhil students that focuses on developing both research and professional skills.</p><p>Doctoral research projects can be based on fieldwork (sometimes in remote places), laboratory experiments, analysis of existing data sets, or mathematical theory, but in all cases must be original and rigorous, leading to publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals. The majority of your time will, therefore, be spent in independent self-directed research and will involve a mixture of experimental, computational and observational activities.</p><p>You will be part of a vibrant educational research community that includes an active set of doctoral student-led events, seminars and workshops.

These may include ancient Bible translations, Qumran texts, the New Testament, Rabbinic hermeneutics, Greek and Latin patristics, or early Syriac commentaries. They will be explored in the essays set which you will present in meetings with your tutor, either in one-to-one sessions or with one or two other students in related subjects (such sessions are known as ‘tutorials’). </p><p>For your other two papers, you will select two options from the following five:</p><ul><li>Hebrew biblical and exegetical texts</li><li>Aramaic biblical, exegetical and Targum texts</li><li>Syriac biblical and exegetical texts</li><li>Greek biblical and exegetical texts</li><li>Latin biblical and exegetical texts. </li></ul><p>Set texts in the first Semitic language (or in Latin and/or Greek if chosen) will be studied in classes in all three terms.</p><p>If required, intensive elementary language teaching in a second Semitic language followed by textual study is available in the first term, comprising two to three hours per week. Since elementary language teaching will start with the basics of the grammar, classes may be shared with beginners in other appropriate courses (Classical Hebrew, Syriac and Aramaic at undergraduate or graduate level). You will be expected to attend such classes regularly, and to complete any homework set in good time. It is also essential to spend time consolidating your knowledge of the grammar and vocabulary of the languages you are studying during the university vacations at Christmas and Easter.</p><p>Most teaching for this Master’s course will take place in small classes or tutorials, normally given mainly by the course convenor, Professor Alison Salvesen, but also supplemented by recommended lectures, classes and seminars. You will be expected to prepare the set texts in advance of each class, in order to derive the maximum benefit from the intense form of study. Numbers of students on the course are very small (one or two per year) and so teaching is tailored according to the needs and interests of individual students. Classes are sometimes shared with those on other similar courses.</p><p>You will also be expected to attend seminars in relevant areas: there are regular seminar series in Jewish Studies in the Greco-Roman Period, Patristics, Late Antique and Byzantine Studies, Hebrew Bible/Old Testament, and New Testament, as well as special lectures given by visiting scholars. An average attendance of two seminars per week in Michaelmas and Hilary terms is advisable, in line with your subject choices and interests.</p><p>You may come to Oxford with precise ideas about the subject of your dissertation, or you may have a broader interest in a particular topic that needs to be developed. Either way, you will be able to discuss dissertation ideas with your supervisor or lecturers towards the end of the first term, spend time thinking and reading over the Christmas vacation, and submit your title at the very beginning of the second term (Hilary). You may meet with your thesis supervisor two or three times over the course of the second term as your work progresses. They will read and offer feedback on two or three drafts over the Easter vacation and the beginning of the third term, before you submit. It is vital to start work on the dissertation early in the academic year, and not to leave it too late.</p><p>Overall, you may expect to spend 10-12 hours attending lectures, seminars, tutorials, and classes each week during term, and a minimum of a further 30 hours on self-directed study. The university vacations are also important times for reading and study, especially the Easter vacation, when you will principally need to focus on your dissertation.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>For this course, the allocation of graduate supervision is the responsibility of the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies and Faculty of Theology and Religion. </p><p>You will be encouraged to discuss your ideas for the dissertation during Michaelmas term and the Christmas vacation, ready for the submission of the approval form to the faculty at the beginning of Hilary term. Thereafter there will be regular supervisions of your dissertation once you have begun the work, at least every two weeks during term until you submit, supplemented with email and online contact over the Easter vacation. </p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>Assessment takes place at the end of the academic year, and takes the form of three examination papers (one on the compulsory core paper, and the other two on prescribed texts), plus a dissertation on some aspect of Bible interpretation in antiquity. The topic and title of the dissertation are chosen in consultation with your supervisor, and the dissertation itself will be submitted at the end of the fourth week of Trinity term, before the examinations for the other papers.</p><p>The first examination paper consists of essay questions for the compulsory core paper on early translations and interpretations of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament. On both of the two papers chosen as options you will be asked to translate into English a number of passages from set texts and comment on points of exegetical and other interest in them, and also to answer one essay on the background or aspects of the set texts. Candidates may be required to attend a viva.</p><p>In taught graduate degrees the pass mark is 50. In the MSt, a distinction may be awarded for a final overall mark of 70 or above. The final mark is arrived at as a numerical mean of the marks on individual papers, with the qualification that you must also pass on each paper individually.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Asian and Middle Eastern studies graduates have found employment in many and diverse fields including business, finance law, civil service, journalism, government and industry.</p><p>Many graduates have also undertaken further research into subjects linked with Asian and Middle Eastern studies and have pursued successful careers in the academic world, education and in museums.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

You will need to take a number of courses during your first year (over two years if studying part-time). Your day will comprise of lectures each morning with laboratory sessions each afternoon. You will undertake two eight- to ten-week mini-projects, precursors to your DPhil study, to hone your research skills and shape your main research area (if studying part-time, you will take one in your first year and the other in your second year). You will meet your supervisor regularly to assess progress and discuss academic issues.</p><p>Years two to four (three to eight if studying part-time) see an increasing emphasis on individual research. You will be encouraged to develop projects based on your own research ideas within the four key research themes of Machine Learning, as a unifying core; Robotics &amp; Vision, Control and Verification, and Cyber-Physical Systems (eg sensor networks). Training will continue in academic reading, writing and presentation skills, business and commerce (to include innovation and IP curatorship and entrepreneurship), career development and planning, and ethics and law, where the societal implications of autonomous systems will be considered.</p><p>Research seminars are used to discuss papers, for rehearsing conference talks and for building links between groups. An annual workshop gives the opportunity to present research to students, industrial partners and invited researchers from other universities. Industrial collaborators are invited to share their latest problems and market trends and to discuss opportunities for future collaboration.</p><p>If studying full-time, you will spend one or two months over the second or third summer in an industrial lab to gain experience in industry-led projects and expanding your horizons by engaging in an AIMS topic that is not your main one. If studying part-time, it is recommended that you take on an internship between years four and six.</p><p>After the end of the internship, further interaction will be encouraged by inviting your industrial supervisors to join your group in Oxford for short periods.</p><p>You will also be encouraged to take demonstrations of your systems to companies, government departments, as well as schools. In the fourth year, the cohort help organise the annual workshop, inviting keynote speakers, participating in the program committee, reviewing papers submitted by second and third year students, and publicising the workshop to universities and industrial partners beyond those directly involved in the CDT.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>For this course, the allocation of graduate supervision is the responsibility of the Department of Engineering Science and/or Department of Computer Science and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Department of Engineering Science and Department of Computer Science. </p><p>Students will be expected to meet their supervisor on a regular basis to discuss their progress. For full-time students, these meetings should take place at least once every two weeks, averaged across the year, and once a month for part-time students.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>If you are studying full-time, you will be assessed continually throughout the first year during courses and projects and at its end the programme supervisors will assess whether sufficient progress has been made to continue to the research phase. At the end of the second year, you will be required to write a report and give a presentation on your research, and to present a detailed and coherent plan for the research-intensive phase in the third and fourth years of your doctoral studies. Progress towards completion is again formally assessed some way into the final year of study.</p><p>If studying part-time, you will be assessed over the first two years. Timings will differ for the presentation for part-time students. </p><p>For the DPhil you will be required to submit a substantial thesis which is read and examined by experts in the field, one from the department and one from elsewhere. Often the thesis will result in the publication of several journal and conference papers.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>The development of a positive group dynamic within and between year groups in the CDT and the progressive increase of responsibility and external exposure, equips graduates from the AIMS programme for leadership roles in industry both nationally and internationally. It is anticipated that others will continue to spend time in postdoctoral research, probably developing the work in their theses towards product.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

Students studying for the DPhil part-time normally study for five to eight years. This compares with a full-time DPhil which normally takes three to four years to complete.", "about": "<div class=\"field-item even\"><div id=\"content-tab\"><p>The DPhil programme draws on considerable experience in providing advanced tuition in architectural history. It profits from the close links within the department between the disciplines of architectural history, art history, English local history and landscape archaeology. It also has links with other parts of the University, particularly the Faculty of History, the Department of History of Art, and Kellogg College, amongst the fellows of which is the largest concentration of architectural historians associated with the University.</p><p>In broad terms, supervision is possible in most areas of British architectural history from the middle ages to the present, and some European and American topics. In terms of Great Britain, academic staff currently have particular research interests in ecclesiastical buildings; country houses and their landscapes; the British home since 1700; railway stations; the history of building conservation; Regency architecture; architecture of the period 1880-1940; Gothic Revival; urban and institutional architecture, especially of London and Oxford, from 1660 to the present.</p><p>The programme is overseen by the Continuing Education Board of the University. Admission is through the Department for Continuing Education. The part-time DPhil regulations require a period of five to eight years’ part-time study (equivalent to three years' full-time). Research students may be required to undertake appropriate research training provided within the department. Doctoral training is provided through the department’s Graduate School, and other agreed learning requirements (eg foreign languages) can draw on the resources of both the department and the wider University.</p><p>As a part-time student you will be required to attend supervision meetings and other obligations in Oxford for a minimum of 30 days each year.</p><p>You will have the opportunity to tailor your part-time study and skills training in liaison with your supervisor and agree your pattern of attendance.</p><p>Graduate students in the department have access to the full range of Oxford’s library, archive and computing facilities. In addition, they will be strongly encouraged to participate in seminars and informal meetings with staff and other researchers both within the Department and elsewhere in the University. The major commitment of time will be to individual study and research, involving wide and intense reading, data collection (which may include fieldwork) and analysis, and writing.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>For this course, the allocation of graduate supervision is the responsibility of the Department for Continuing Education and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Department for Continuing Education.</p><p>Supervision on the DPhil programme is provided by specialist tutors from the department and elsewhere in Oxford. It is provided on an individual basis, tailored to the specific needs of students and to their subjects. Students on the DPhil are required to attend a minimum of 30 days of university-based work each year for the duration of your studies, usually that involves meeting their supervisor once a term.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>You will be admitted initially as a Probationary Research Student (PRS), in line with University regulations on doctorates. During the probationary period, you will develop and begin work on the thesis topic. You will develop research skills through a range of training and skills development primarily offered via the Department for Continuing Education Graduate School, as well as across the University.</p><p>Students must apply for a Transfer of Status from PRS to DPhil status between the sixth and the eighth academic term after admission, each academic year at Oxford having three terms. This involves the submission of a piece of written work that is examined by two assessors, neither of whom will be your supervisors. This process is to ensure that your work is of potential DPhil quality and that the methodology of the research is appropriate and feasible. Upon successful completion of the Transfer of Status, you would usually undertake a period of primary fieldwork/data collection over one to two years.</p><p>You will also be required to apply for a Confirmation of Status as DPhil sometime between the twelfth and eighteenth term after admission. This will also involve the submission of a piece of written work that is assessed by two assessors, neither of whom will be your supervisors. The Confirmation of Status assessment is different to the Transfer of Status assessment as the assessors will be focusing on how the research is progressing, the quality of the draft chapters/papers, and on the plan for completion. The assessors will be looking to ensure that you are making the appropriate amount of progress in the development of your thesis, so that thesis submission will be achieved within the time limit.</p><p>You will be expected to submit a substantive academic thesis of around 100,000 words after six or, at most, eight years from the date of admission. To be successfully awarded a DPhil in Architectural History you will need to defend your thesis orally (viva voce) in front of two appointed examiners. This thesis should be driven by a research question suitable for original historical enquiry; should make considered and effective use of appropriate sources (which should be consulted in the original so far as appropriate and practical); must have a coherent approach or method – one that is thought out and intellectually sustainable; should demonstrate a good general knowledge of the particular field of learning within which the thesis falls; show that the candidate has made a significant and substantial contribution in their particular field of learning; and should be presented in a lucid and scholarly manner.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>The number of students completing the DPhil is too small to provide information on destinations.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

Most of the dissertation research and writing takes place in the third term and into the summer. The dissertation allows you to develop a larger piece of research in which you can more fully explore a topic. It will allow you to develop your research skills and undertake self-directed and independent research that is a necessary basis for future doctoral research, and highly desirable in non-academic employment.</p><h3>Teaching and learning</h3><p>Teaching of stream modules is mainly through a combination of lectures and tutorials which are normally taught in small- groups. Other teaching methods may also include seminars, museum-based classes, laboratory work or other practicals, depending on your stream and module choices. You will usually prepare formative assignments on a weekly or fortnightly basis for your modules. The core Archaeological Principles: Data and Theory module is taught by lectures and seminars and will include group work; the assignments given in this module will form the basis of an assessed portfolio.</p><p>The teaching methods provide you with the opportunity to debate and discuss essays and topics on a regular basis with other students and teachers. Your assignments will also allow you to develop your writing and presentation skills. The seminars, museum-based classes, laboratory work and practicals provide an arena for you to engage with and develop techniques of analysis and evaluation.</p><p>You will have an academic advisor in your subject stream who will advise on module choices and monitor overall progress.</p><p>The teaching is supplemented by a wide range of lecture courses, seminar series, and the Graduate Archaeology at Oxford skills seminar series available in the School of Archaeology. The degree is a very intensive course, and you will be expected to treat the University vacations as integral parts of your academic work time.</p><p>Each member of the academic staff in archaeology normally offers at least one module in his or her areas of specialism over the year, but some modules or streams listed may not be available every year.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>You will have a dissertation supervisor who, during your supervision meetings, will discuss and guide your research. They will usually be one of the teachers in your subject stream.</p><p>For this course, the allocation of graduate supervision is the responsibility of the School of Archaeology and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the School of Archaeology.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>The Archaeological Principles: Data and Theory core module is assessed by a portfolio of work.</p><p>Your first subject stream module will be assessed by take-home essays submitted in the second term.</p><p>Your second subject stream module and your chosen option module will be assessed by extended essays submitted in the third term.</p><p>A stream-specific dissertation of a maximum of 15,000 words will be submitted in late August.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>It is anticipated that graduates from the MSc in Archaeology will continue to further degree programmes in Archaeology either at Oxford or at leading universities elsewhere. Others may find careers in education, museums, commercial archaeology and the heritage industry.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

Completing the DPhil on a part-time basis normally requires between six and eight years of study, compared with a full-time DPhil which normally takes three to four years to complete.", "about": "<div class=\"field-item even\"><div id=\"content-tab\"><p>The part-time DPhil programme draws on knowledge and skills acquired over many years of providing specialist classes in archaeology and profits from close links with the many different archaeologists elsewhere in the University. It caters for students specialising mainly in landscape and professional archaeology topics, largely concentrated on Britain and Europe. Occasionally, other topics are accepted but admission in these cases is strictly dependent on the availability of appropriate supervision elsewhere in the university. Please note that candidates, even those with an academically strong background, may not be admitted if appropriate supervision is not available for your proposed research topic.</p><p>The DPhil programme is overseen by the University’s Continuing Education Board, and admission is through the Department for Continuing Education. The part-time DPhil regulations normally require a minimum of six years’ part-time study (equivalent to three years full-time). If you are a research student you may be required to undertake appropriate research training provided within the department. In addition, you will be strongly encouraged to participate in seminars and informal meetings with staff and other researchers. The major commitment of time will be to individual study and research, involving wide and intense reading, data collection and analysis, and writing.</p><p>As a part-time student you will be required to attend supervision, training, seminars, milestone assessments (e.g. transfer of status) and other obligations in Oxford for a minimum of 30 days each year.</p><p>There will be flexibility in the dates and pattern of attendance, which will be determined by mutual agreement with your supervisor. Any dates for fieldwork should be discussed with your supervisor.</p><p>When not in physical attendance at Oxford, you will be expected to continue your research to an agreed time-plan. Your supervision will continue as normal, via online and remote means. You should take account of any time differences when planning online meetings with your supervisor or graduate training.</p><p>You will have access to the full range of Oxford’s library, archive and computing facilities. You are encouraged to participate as fully as possible in the wider research environment for archaeology at Oxford, including attending seminars, discussion groups and lectures advertised by the School of Archaeology, Oxford University Archaeological Society and Graduate Archaeology Oxford and elsewhere in the University. The Department for Continuing Education has its own stock of fieldwork equipment and access to specialist facilities elsewhere in the University may be arranged where these are required.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Department for Continuing Education and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. A supervisor may be found outside the Department for Continuing Education.</p><p>Supervision is arranged to suit the DPhil topic. The department’s full-time academic archaeologists, Professor David Griffiths (Programme Director for Archaeology) and Dr Alison MacDonald (Departmental Lecturer in Archaeology), supervise the programme, along with research associates of the department and colleagues from the School of Archaeology, Faculty of Classics and elsewhere within the University.</p><p>Students on the DPhil are required to attend a minimum of 30 days of university-based work each year for the duration of their studies, usually that involves meeting their supervisor once a term.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>You will be admitted initially as a Probationary Research Student (PRS), in line with University regulations on doctorates. During the probationary period, you will develop and begin work on the thesis topic. You will develop research skills through a range of training and skills development primarily offered via the Department for Continuing Education Graduate School, as well as across the University.</p><p>Students must apply for a Transfer of Status from PRS to DPhil status between the sixth and the eighth academic term after admission, each academic year at Oxford having three terms. This involves the submission of a piece of written work that is examined by two assessors, neither of whom will be your supervisors. This process is to ensure that your work is of potential DPhil quality and that the methodology of the research is appropriate and feasible. Upon successful completion of the Transfer of Status, you would usually undertake a period of primary fieldwork/data collection over one to two years.</p><p>You will also be required to apply for a Confirmation of Status as DPhil sometime between the twelfth and eighteenth term after admission. This will also involve the submission of a piece of written work that is assessed by two assessors, neither of whom are your supervisors. The Confirmation of Status assessment is different to the Transfer of Status assessment as the assessors will be focusing on how the research is progressing, the quality of the draft chapters/papers, and on the plan for completion. The assessors will be looking to ensure that you are making the appropriate amount of progress in the development of your thesis, so that thesis submission will be achieved within the time limit.</p><p>You will be expected to submit a substantive academic thesis of around 80,000 words after eighteen or, at most, twenty-four terms from the date of admission. To be successfully awarded a DPhil in Archaeology you will need to defend your thesis orally (viva voce) in front of two appointed examiners.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Employment in the commercial archaeological and heritage sector, university post-doctoral research, museum work, consultancy, and activity with voluntary heritage groups. </p><p>Graduates have taken on senior roles in academic research and professional practice. Several have become research associates on externally funded University of Oxford research projects, and have combined this with developing teaching careers in higher education. One served as Chair of the Institute for Archaeologists, the UK’s leading professional body. Others have developed careers in heritage and archaeological practice, working for organisations such as Oxford Archaeology.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

Applicants are encouraged to contact prospective supervisors, academics in the School of Archaeology, that share similar research interests so that they can discuss project ideas and get advice. Projects which cross disciplinary boundaries, for example in archaeological science or cultural heritage, are also welcome. Details of the department's research areas and themes, and recently completed DPhil projects are listed on the department's website. (See <em>Further information and enquiries</em>).</p><p>There are no specific taught elements although students are encouraged to attend lectures and participate in research seminars, particularly the skills seminars and some of those in the wide-ranging weekly seminar series organised within the research groups.

You will need to take a number of courses during your first year (over two years if studying part-time). Your day will comprise of lectures each morning with laboratory sessions each afternoon. You will undertake two eight- to ten-week mini-projects, precursors to your DPhil study, to hone your research skills and shape your main research area (if studying part-time, you will take one in your first year and the other in your second year). You will meet your supervisor regularly to assess progress and discuss academic issues.</p><p>Years two to four (three to eight if studying part-time) see an increasing emphasis on individual research. You will be encouraged to develop projects based on your own research ideas within the four key research themes of Machine Learning, as a unifying core; Robotics &amp; Vision, Control and Verification, and Cyber-Physical Systems (eg sensor networks). Training will continue in academic reading, writing and presentation skills, business and commerce (to include innovation and IP curatorship and entrepreneurship), career development and planning, and ethics and law, where the societal implications of autonomous systems will be considered.</p><p>Research seminars are used to discuss papers, for rehearsing conference talks and for building links between groups. An annual workshop gives the opportunity to present research to students, industrial partners and invited researchers from other universities. Industrial collaborators are invited to share their latest problems and market trends and to discuss opportunities for future collaboration.</p><p>If studying full-time, you will spend one or two months over the second or third summer in an industrial lab to gain experience in industry-led projects and expanding your horizons by engaging in an AIMS topic that is not your main one. If studying part-time, it is recommended that you take on an internship between years four and six.</p><p>After the end of the internship, further interaction will be encouraged by inviting your industrial supervisors to join your group in Oxford for short periods.</p><p>You will also be encouraged to take demonstrations of your systems to companies, government departments, as well as schools. In the fourth year, the cohort help organise the annual workshop, inviting keynote speakers, participating in the program committee, reviewing papers submitted by second and third year students, and publicising the workshop to universities and industrial partners beyond those directly involved in the CDT.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>For this course, the allocation of graduate supervision is the responsibility of the Department of Engineering Science and/or Department of Computer Science and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Department of Engineering Science and Department of Computer Science. </p><p>Students will be expected to meet their supervisor on a regular basis to discuss their progress. For full-time students, these meetings should take place at least once every two weeks, averaged across the year, and once a month for part-time students.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>If you are studying full-time, you will be assessed continually throughout the first year during courses and projects and at its end the programme supervisors will assess whether sufficient progress has been made to continue to the research phase. At the end of the second year, you will be required to write a report and give a presentation on your research, and to present a detailed and coherent plan for the research-intensive phase in the third and fourth years of your doctoral studies. Progress towards completion is again formally assessed some way into the final year of study.</p><p>If studying part-time, you will be assessed over the first two years. Timings will differ for the presentation for part-time students. </p><p>For the DPhil you will be required to submit a substantial thesis which is read and examined by experts in the field, one from the department and one from elsewhere. Often the thesis will result in the publication of several journal and conference papers.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>The development of a positive group dynamic within and between year groups in the CDT and the progressive increase of responsibility and external exposure, equips graduates from the AIMS programme for leadership roles in industry both nationally and internationally. It is anticipated that others will continue to spend time in postdoctoral research, probably developing the work in their theses towards product.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

The course is intended for those with a degree (undergraduate or postgraduate) or an advanced diploma in archaeology or a related subject.", "about": "<div class=\"field-item even\"><div id=\"content-tab\"><p>This MSc is a part-time modular course over two years, leading to a University of Oxford graduate degree in archaeology. The course is designed for the needs of students who wish to study part-time, and this includes those who are in full-time employment. Those with a personal or professional interest in landscape archaeology are welcome to apply.</p><p>Landscape archaeology is an increasingly popular and widely understood concept. Using a multi-period approach, it is concerned with understanding past human impacts on the resources, topography and environment of the whole landscape, from uplands to coasts, and from farmed landscapes to urban/industrial areas.</p><p>Many newer methods of research are being developed in landscape archaeology, including digital mapping and geophysics and remote-sensing techniques such as LIDAR. These are taking their place alongside field-walking, historic landscape analysis, aerial photography and selective excavation to provide a flexible and effective armoury of techniques for the researcher. Skills such as survey and characterisation are becoming essential for anyone involved in the management of the historic environment. Effective communication of the value and potential of the historic landscape is vital in the world of planning, tourism, outreach and education.</p><p>The course involves a combination of academic study and field practice. It is designed to appeal to those who already have experience of studying archaeology (or a closely-related subject) at undergraduate or postgraduate level and who wish to expand their academic, practical and professional skills in landscape archaeology.</p><p>With a strong (but not exclusive) emphasis on the archaeology of Britain in our teaching, the course focuses on the applications of research methods in varying landscape situations. The course format is flexible and enables students to pursue their own research interests leading to a 15,000-word dissertation. This can be on a theme, area or subject in Britain or elsewhere. </p><p>The course is taught using a combination of lectures/seminars in Oxford, field visits and practical work, supported by tutor contact and information supplied via a Virtual learning Environment (VLE) which can be accessed at any time. The majority of teaching takes place on Saturdays, normally between 10am and 4pm. There is a landscape survey training week in the early summer of the final year (Year B), which requires attendance over seven days (Saturday to Friday). Self-study in libraries or at home will form a major part of your experience on the course. Many students undertake some fieldwork during their time on the course. Dissertations are supported through personal tutorials with the course director and/or your dissertation tutor.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Department for Continuing Education and this role will usually be performed by the Course Director. It is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Department for Continuing Education.</p><p>The Course Director acts as academic supervisor for all students over the two years. A dissertation tutor will also be appointed at the appropriate time in the course when your topic is approved (usually early in the second year). This may be the Course Director, or another of the course teaching team. Students normally consult their dissertation tutor between four and six times, online or in person.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>The course is assessed through a series of written assignments and a practical log-book. Two Core Papers (taught in Term One in each year) have two written assignments, and four advanced papers (taught in Terms Two and Three in each year) have one written assignment each. (Where an optional flexi-placement is taken, this results in an assignment which replaces one of the advanced papers). The landscape survey training week has a practical log book, and there is a dissertation. All students are required to attend an oral examination (<em>viva voce</em>) at the end, in order to pass the course.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>A number of students have gone on to DPhil/PhD programmes at Oxford and elsewhere, several of which have been funded. Others have developed their careers in UK and European heritage professions, including working for organisations such as Historic England, The National Trust for Scotland, Oxford Archaeology, National Museums Liverpool, Ministry of Defence, National Maritime Museum, McDonald Institute (University of Cambridge) county and regional heritage, HERs and curatorial advisory services, Portable Antiquities Scheme, and in commercial consultancy and field practice. Others have used the knowledge and learning experience gained on the course in their existing roles, such as in teaching, policy, or landscape management. </p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-snippet-markup field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n<span class=\"field-item-single\"><div class=\"annualchanges-shade\"><h3>Changes to this course and your supervision</h3><p>The University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

Part I is the first year of taught study during which you must be resident in Oxford if you are studying full-time. If studying part-time, you must participate regularly in accordance with University regulations for part-time study. You may transfer from full-time to part-time after the first year. As a part-time student, you may be non-residential but you must attend classes and seminars in Oxford on one day each week (currently Fridays) during your first year and continue to take part in occasional seminars and supervisions for your essays during the subsequent years.

If studying part-time, you will attend these classes during their first year. The classes will include required reading and discussion. Extended essays for particular units will be supervised by an individual tutor. In addition to the core classes, the Applied Theology Research Seminars provide an opportunity for all students to hear from senior members of the University as well as visiting scholars. The Research Presentation Seminars allow students to present their current research to one another and receive feedback.

This dissertation can be completed part-time.</p><h3>Supervision</h3><p>You will be assigned supervisors to help you formulate and prepare your essay projects, as well as the dissertation. The number of meetings with supervisors will vary, but you should expect regular, at least fortnightly interactions with supervisors, tutors or course coordinators, whether at classes or in one-to-one meetings.</p><p>For this course, the allocation of graduate supervision is the responsibility of the Faculty of Theology and Religion and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff.

There are two submission windows each year: after the end of Hilary term (Friday of 0th week of Trinity term) and at the end of the Long Vacation (Friday of 0th week of Michaelmas term). In most circumstances, full-time students submit one essay (typically the Doctrine, Context and Practice unit), or occasionally two, after the end of Hilary term and the rest of the Part I essays at the end of the Long Vacation. Occasionally, permission is given to submit the Experiential Project at the end of Hilary term of the second year. The dissertation must be submitted by the end of the second Long Vacation. Submission timelines for part-time students typically require at least one essay submitted ideally by the end of the first Hilary term but at the latest by the end of the first Long Vacation and the rest of the Part I essays by the end of the second Long Vacation. The dissertation would then be due before completing their time on the course.</p><h3>Graduate destinations</h3><p>Students who leave the University of Oxford with graduate degrees in theology enter a variety of careers all around the world. The majority who graduate with the MTh in Applied Theology secure employment in Christian ministry or other faith-based pastoral contexts.
